# Photoshop Tools

## Crop Tool

- Hold shift after you start resizing a side in order to snap to the pixel grid.

## Magic Wand Tool

- "Quick Selection" vs. "Magic Wand": The Magic Wand is more automatic, and good for large areas of the same color. The Quick Selection tool is more manual and is good for areas where the color is inconsistent.
