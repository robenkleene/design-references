# Photoshop Transparency

## Replacing a Black Background With Transparency

You can replace a black background with transparency by right-clicking a layer and choosing `Blending Options...`. Then using the `Blend If:` slider, move the `This Layer:` slider to the right, and adjust further by holding `‚å•` and dragging to separate the two halves of the slider.

Note that this doesn't get as good results as using a `Lighten` blend mode.
