# Photoshop 3D Camera

`view` is the drop-down menu to select a camera.

- `Properties Panel > 3D Camera > View > Save...`: Save the camera
- `Properties Panel > 3D Camera > View > Delete`: Delete the camera

There doesn't appear to be a way to update a camera, so simply delete the old camera and save again to update it.
