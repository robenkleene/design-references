# Photoshop Grids & Guidelines

- `âŒ˜'`: Toggle grid

## Grid Settings

- `Photoshop > Preferences > Guides, Grids & Slices...`: Change grid settings

## Tips

- It can be hard to see the difference between grid lines and subdivisions. It's much easier if you set the grid color to black (then the subdivision lines will be gray).

## Guidelines

### Centering

- With snap turned on, guidelines will snap to the center. This isn't linked to any of the specific snap options, so choosing `View > Snap To > None` first will help with noise from other snap targets.
