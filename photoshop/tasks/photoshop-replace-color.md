# Photoshop Replace Color

The `Image > Adjustments > Replace Color...` command won't work for black and white (because those are the absence of color, not colors).

For black, `Image > Adjustments > Selective Color...` will work, choose black for `Colors:`, then use the sliders to select a new color.
