# Photoshop 3D

- In 3D mode, the three icons in the lower right orbit, pan, and dolly (zoom).

## Views

You can take a view of your model and save it under the `Properties` panel with the `3D Camera` icon selected. Choose `Save…` from the `View:` drop-down menu. This allows you to rotate your model and view it from other angles while always being able to return to a saved view.

## Manipulator

The manipulator appears when a 3D object is selected.

- The manipulator has a arrow, curve, and square for each axis. The arrow moves, the curve rotates, and the square scales. The square in the center scales all axes simultaneously.
- You can scale the size of the manipulator itself by dragging the center square and holding `⇧`.
