# Photoshop 3D Text

1. Start with an existing document with a good place to add something 3D
2. Use the Type Tool to add the letters "3D".
3. Click the "3D" icon in the Type Tool's toolbar.
4. Find the vanishing point, and then drag a horizontal guideline and position it at the vanishing point, this is the horizon line.
5. In the 3D panel (you can always get the 3D panel back by double-clicking the 3D layer), select the camera ("Current View"). This will show a grid of converging lines, and a horizon line. Using the "Orbit the 3D camera" button in the lower left, adjust the horizon line for the 3D camera to match our horizon line guideline.
