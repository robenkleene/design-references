# Photoshop Vanishing Point Perspective

To move the vanishing point, e.g., to center a perspective shot looking down a bridge:

(The vanishing point is where all of the perspective lines converge.)

1. Select the object bridge, probably with the Quick Selection Tool, save the selection ("Save" > "Save Selection").
2. Copy and paste the object to a new layer.
3. Setup guides at the right and left edge closest part of the bridge to you. Make a third guide at the center between those two points.
4. Use "Edit > Perspective Warp" to adjust the object.
