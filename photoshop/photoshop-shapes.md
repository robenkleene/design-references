# Photoshop Shapes

## Tips

- To hide that blue box around shape layers, "View > Show > Target Path" (`⇧⌘H`).
- To select points on a shape path, use the "Direct Selection Tool" (`A`), and hold `⌘` while dragging a selection box around the points to select.

## Rounded Rectangles

To change the rounded corner radius, or add rounded corners to an existing rectangle shape, just go to "Properties" with that layer selected.
