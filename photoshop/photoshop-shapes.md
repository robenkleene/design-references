# Photoshop Shapes

## Tips

- To hide that blue box around shape layers, `View > Show > Target Path` (`⇧⌘H`).
- To select points on a shape path, use the `Direct Selection Tool` (`A`), and hold `⌘` while dragging a selection box around the points to select.

## Rounded Rectangles

There's no longer a rounded rectangle tool, now just used the regular rectangle tool and adjust the radius.

To change the rounded corner radius, or add rounded corners to an existing rectangle shape, just go to `Properties` with that layer selected.

## Center a Shape Layer

1. `⌘A` to select all
2. `v` to use the move tool
3. In the tool bar, click the align buttons to vertically and horizontally center the layer
