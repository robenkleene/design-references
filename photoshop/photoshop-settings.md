# Photoshop Settings

## Preferences

- Disable the home screen with `Preferences (⌘K) > General > Auto show the Home Screen`
- To invert `⇧` with transform, toggle on `Preferences (⌘K) > General > Use Legacy Free Transform`
- Toggle on `Preferences (⌘K) > General > Export Clipboard` to help export the clipboard
- Toggle off `Preference (⌘K) > Tools > Overscroll` to prevent scrolling when reaching the edge of the canvas
- Toggle off `Preferences > Tools > Show Rich Tooltips` to get rid of the big tool tips

## Other

- To make the zoom tool (magnifying glass) work correctly when dragging, disable `Scrubby Zoom` in the toolbar.
- To remove the contextual toolbar, toggle off `Window > Contextual Toolbar`

## Key Bindings

- `⌘⇧⌥K`: `Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts...`

## Notes

- Photoshop uses the last default colors and text styles that you used. Therefore, for customizations, think of applying a style to the currently selected layer, rather than setting the current color.
