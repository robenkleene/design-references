# Photoshop Settings

- Disable the home screen with `General > Auto show the Home Screen`
- To make the zoom tool (magnifying glass) work correctly when dragging, disable `Scrubby Zoom` in the toolbar.
- To invert `⇧` with transform, toggle on `Preferences > General > Use Legacy Free Transform`
- Use the darkest theme (obviously) under `Preferences > Interface`
- Disable the ridiculous huge pop-up tooltips, by toggling off `Preferences > Tools > Show Rich Tooltips`.

## Key Bindings

- `⌘⇧⌥K`: "Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts..."

## Notes

- Photoshop uses the last default colors and text styles that you used. Therefore, for customizations, think of applying a style to the currently selected layer, rather than setting the current color.
