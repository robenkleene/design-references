# Photoshop Settings

- `⌘K`: Show preferences

## Preferences

- Toggle on `Preferences > General > Export Clipboard` to help export the clipboard (without this copying the selection with `⇧⌘C` and pasting into another application will fail)

### Quiet

- Disable the home screen with `Preferences > General > Auto show the Home Screen`
- `Preferences > Notifications > Enable quiet mode`: Disables rich tooltips, tool onboarding, and what's new

## Other

- Toggle off `Preferences > General > Resize Image During Place` to make it easier to drop multiple screenshots together for compositing at their original size
- To invert `⇧` with transform, toggle on `Preferences > General > Use Legacy Free Transform`
- To make the zoom tool (magnifying glass) work correctly when dragging, disable `Scrubby Zoom` in the toolbar.
- To remove the contextual toolbar, toggle off `Window > Contextual Task Bar`

## Key Bindings

- `⌘⇧⌥K`: `Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts...`

## Notes

- Photoshop uses the last default colors and text styles that you used. Therefore, for customizations, think of applying a style to the currently selected layer, rather than setting the current color.
