# Photoshop Masks

- `⌥⌘G`: Clip layer to the layer below

## Layer Masks vs. Clipping Masks

- A *layer mask* is added to a layer, it uses black to hide pixels, and white to show pixels.
- A *clipping mask* controls visibility of one layer with the transparency of another.

## Shape Layers

To mask a layer from a shape layer, `⌘-drag` the shape layer onto the layer to mask (note that this doesn't work to mask another shape layer).

## Tips

- To center a masked layer, convert it to a smart object.
