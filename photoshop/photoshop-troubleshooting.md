# Photoshop Troubleshooting

## Missing Tools

- Toggle back on `Window > Tools`

## Hand Tool

- If spacebar isn't working to select the hand tool, that's probably because secure input mode is on. You can check by running Keyboard Maestro, which will tell you.

## Paths

- If you can't stroke a path, try just looking in the toolbar instead of the sidebar, sometimes the option is still there just not visible in the sidebar.

## "Index" Layer

If there's an index layer that you can't edit, just choose another mode under `Image > Mode`.
