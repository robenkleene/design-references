# Houdini Settings

Add this to `~/Library/Preferences/houdini/<houdini-version>/houdini.env` in order to pan with right-click:

    HOUDINI_MMB_PAN = 0

In Preferences, set `Global UI Scale: 2`

## Theme

- `Edit > Color Settings... > User Interface`: Choose between Houdini Light and Dark

## Notes

- Don't use `Native Choosers` in the file dialog, too many bugs where the file picker gets stuck and Houdini needs to be restarted.

## Hotkeys

Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Edit > Hotkeys...`
