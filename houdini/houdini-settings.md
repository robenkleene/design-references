# Houdini Settings

Add this to `~/Library/Preferences/houdini/<houdini-version>/houdini.env` in order to pan with right-click:

    HOUDINI_MMB_PAN = 0

In Preferences, set `Global UI Scale: 2`

## Notes

- Don't use "Native Choosers", too many bugs where the file picker gets stuck and Houdini needs to be restarted.

## Hotkeys

"Edit > Hotkeys..."
