# Houdini Troubleshooting

- If you get in a weird state where zooming is causing your model to disappear (e.g., clipping), then hit `‚ê£ G` to go home.
- If clicking the blue `Display/Render` button on a node isn't making only that node display in the viewport, try first going up a level and toggling off `Display/Render` for the parent node.
