# Houdini Modeling

## Manipulators

- `T`: Move
- `R`: Rotate
- `E`: Scale
- `Enter`: Show all manipulators at once

## General Approach

1. Hold `S` and click to select
2. Hit the letter for the manipulator
3. Make the change
4. Hit `⎋` (or hit the key for a different modeling tool to keep editing)
