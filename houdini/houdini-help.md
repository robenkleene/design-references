# Houdini Help

- Hover a parameter to see a tooltip, then hit `F1` to open a help pane for that parameter
- Right-click a node and choose `Help...`

## Help Pane

Houdini has offline help that can be accessed through "Help > Show Help Pane". Or simply by right-clicking any tab in Houdini and selecting "Help Browser" as its pane type.

A good tip to get the help in a separate floating window is to first select "Window > New Floating Panel" (`⌥⇧W`).

Floating Panels often get stuck, so another way to get a help browser is to create a new tab (`⌘T`) and right-click the tab and select "Help Browser".
