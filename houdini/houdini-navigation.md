# Houdini Navigation

- `Drag`: Orbit
- `Scroll`: Zoom
- `Right-Drag`: Pan (this only works if the `HOUDINI_MMB_PAN = 0` environment variable is set

## Troubleshooting

If none of these are working you might be in `Edit` mode, hit `⎋` to switch back to `View` mode.

## Shortcuts

- `⌘F`: Search for nodes by name
- `⇧/` (`?`): Quick open node (to quickly jump between networks, like `/obj` and `/mat`, select all with `⌘A` then type `/`)
- `⇧F`: Focus selected object (when the viewport has focus)

## Dependencies

- Right-click `View Dependencies...`: Show references to a node, this is the easiest way to see which node is using a material for example.
