# Houdini Materials

## Applying a Material

Applying a material to an object.

1. Switch to the `Materials Palette`, drag the desired material from the hierarchy on the left to the area on the right. This makes the material available in the scene.
2. Select a geometry node, and switch to the `Render` tab, and choose set the `Material` field to the material

### Tips

- You can also drag a material from the `Material Palette` onto an object in the viewport.
- You can also add a `Material` node in a geometry network (select the material for the `Material` property). This can be used to add materials to more complex geometry.
