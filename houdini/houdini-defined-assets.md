# Houdini

Some nodes are defined by files on disk, these nodes will have a lock icon next to them and their info will show a `Defined By` parameter, set to a path on disk.

These nodes can not be edited, while they are locked (you'll get a "Permission Denied" error if you try).

- To make them editable, right-click and choose `Allow Editing of Contents`
- To lock them again, right-click and choose `Match Current Definition`
