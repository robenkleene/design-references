# Houdini Constraints

## Look At

1. In the toolbar, choose `Constraints > Look At`
2. If an object is already selected that will automatically be chosen as the source object (otherwise choose the source object and hit enter)
3. Select the destination object and hit enter
4. Another destination object can be chosen or hit enter again to finish and create the constraint
