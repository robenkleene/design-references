# Houdini VEXpression

- `âŒ¥E` is supposed to open a separate editor pane, but it doesn't work on macOS probably because of macOS accented character handling. This option is `Open Editor` in the `Hotkey Manager` (`Edit > Hotkeys...`)

## Code

- `@P`: Current position
- `$PI`: Pi
- `@TimeInc`: Current frame
