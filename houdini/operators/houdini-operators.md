You can see the type of an operator by hovering over the node and clicking the `i` icon

- **DOP**: "Dynamic Operator", construct simulations, read geometry from SOPs
- **POP**: "Particle Operator", these are DOPs now.
- **SOP**: "Surface Operator", construct and modify geometry.
- **VEX**: A language for writing shaders and custom nodes.
- **COP**: "Composite Operator", composite image sequences, such as images behind VFX, or combine FX.
- **VOP**: "Vector Operator", this can modify almost anything, e.g., shaders, geo, volumes, VDBs, and points.
