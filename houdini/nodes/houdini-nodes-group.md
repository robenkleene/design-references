# Houdini Nodes Group

## Spreadsheet

- When viewing the spreadsheet, all the nodes in the group will have their row number highlighted orange
- You can see which group a point is in by checking the spreadsheet columns, for example the farthest right columns might say `group:<groupname>` a `1` value in the column means the row is in the group

## Viewport

- When the group node is set to `Display/Render` (blue tab), the viewport will highlight all the points in the group orange
