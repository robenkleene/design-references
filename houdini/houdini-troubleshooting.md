# Houdini Troubleshooting

- If you get in a weird state where zooming is causing your model to disappear (e.g., clipping), then hit `␣ G` to go home.
- If clicking the blue `Display/Render` button on a node isn't making only that node display in the viewport, try first going up a level and toggling off `Display/Render` for the parent node.

## Parameters

- If a parameter is underlined in red, this means it has been adding to the Channel List (`⇧Right-Click`), to remove it, right-click and choose `Channels > Remove from Channel List`.
- If a parameter has a green background and can't be changed, this is because it has a keyframe. To remove it, `RMB` the parameter and choose `Keyfames > Remove Keyframe`

## Viewport

If you get in a state where you can't move in the viewport, you probably got out of View mode. View mode can be restored by clicking the `View` icon (looks like video camera) in the left sidebar (or hit `⎋`).
