# Houdini Troubleshooting

## Parameters

- If a parameter is underlined in red, this means it has been adding to the Channel List (`⇧Right-Click`), to remove it, right-click and choose `Channels > Remove from Channel List`.
- If a parameter has a green background and can't be changed, this is because it has a keyframe. To remove it, `RMB` the parameter and choose `Keyfames > Remove Keyframe`

## Viewport

If you get in a state where you can't move in the viewport, you probably got out of View mode. View mode can be restored by clicking the `View` icon (looks like video camera) in the left sidebar (or hit `⎋`).
