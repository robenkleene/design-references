# Houdini Network Editor

- `⇥`: Add a node
- `⌥←` / `U`: Return from viewing inside and object
- `Two-Finger-Drag`: Zoom
- `Right-Drag`: Pan
- `H`: Home in on nodes (zoom to fit)
- `L`: Re-layout network, e.g., fit nodes to a grid

## Rare

- `C`: Bring up a color palette that can be used to color nodes

## Notes

- When naming a node, space just enters an underscore because nodes can't have spaces in there names.
- You can drag out a connection and then click `⇥` to add an object already connected
- You can drag out a connection, and then hit `⇥` to add an object, and the object will automatically be connected.
- You can select points in the `Scene View` (with `2`) and then automatically have a new node target them when it's added by leaving the cursor over the `Scene View` and hitting `tab` to add a node.

## Layout

- `L`: Layout nodes
