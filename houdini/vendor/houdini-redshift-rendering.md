# Houdini Redshift Rendering

- `Redshift > ViewportIPR`: Start an IPR render view in the viewport
- Add the `Redshift` shelve if it's missing by clicking the `+` icon to the right of the list of shelves

## Render View

- Under the `Redshift` shelf, click `RenderView` to see the render (or you can just switch to the Render View (`⌥9`, switch back with `⌥1`) and click `Render`)

### IPR

- The `RenderView` can be an IPR just buy clicking the `Start/Stop IPR` button

### Side-by-Side

- To put the `RenderView` in a tab pane spilt, click the disclosure arrow to the upper right of any pane and choose `Split Pane Left/Right` (or `Top/Bottom`), then choose right click the pane tab title and choose `Redshift RenderView`
