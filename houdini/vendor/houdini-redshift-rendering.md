# Houdini Redshit Rendering

## Setup Materials

1. Close all the tabs except `/obj` (`⌘W`)
2. Make two new tabs (`⌘T`)
3. Toggle on the pin icon for all three tabs (so they don't follow selection)
4. Set the three tabs to : `/obj`, `/mat`, `/out`
5. On the `/mat` tab, add a `RS Material Builder` node

## Setup Rendering Pipeline

1. Make sure the `Redshift` shelf is visible, by clicking the `+` icon to the right of the list of shelves at the top of the Houdini window
2. In the shelves, click `Redshift > Redshift` (which will generate `/out > Redshift_ROP1 > Redshift_IPR1`)
