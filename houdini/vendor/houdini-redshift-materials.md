# Houdini Redshift Materials

1. Under `/mat`, add a `RS Material Builder` node, go up a level (`⌥←`) and name the material
    - You can replace the `RS Standard Material` and with an `RS Material` (the latter conveniently has a `Presets` option at the top of the `Parameters` panel). (`RS Standard Material` is an updated version from Redshift of `RS Material` with improved realism.)
