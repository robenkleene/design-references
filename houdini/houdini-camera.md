# Houdini Camera

## New Camera

- Create a camera by clicking the "New Camera" in the camera pull-down menu in the upper right of the viewport.
- `âŒ˜-click` the "Camera" icon in the toolbar to insert a camera based on the current view.

## Lock Camera

The lock icon in the "Display options" (toolbar to the right of the "3D Scene View") locks the view port to the camera, so that navigating the scene also moves the camera.
