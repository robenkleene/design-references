# Houdini Window Management

## Splits

- The GUI button in the upper right (white square if there's a single view) lets you choose a window arrangement
- `⌘1`: Single view
- `⌘2`: Two splits side-by-side
- `⌘4`: Four splits

## Tabs

Note in this context, "tab" is just the smaller panels, not the entire window

- `⌘W`: Close the current tab
- `⌘T`: Duplicate the current tab
- `⌘PgUp` / `⌘PgDn`: Next / previous tab
    - Also `⌘tab` / `⇧⌘tab`, which is of course useless and obnoxious because it conflicts with one of macOS's most common shortcuts
