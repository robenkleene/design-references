# Houdini Window Management

- `⇧/` (`?`): Quick open node (to quickly jump between networks, like `/obj` and `/mat`, select all with `⌘A` then type `/`)

## Splits

There are two types of splits.

### Viewport Splits

Viewport splits allow viewing the same scene from multiple angles at once.

- Splitting the viewport is done by clicking the square icon in the upper right (the icon shows the current number of viewport splits)
- `⌘1`: Single view
- `⌘2`: Two splits side-by-side
- `⌘4`: Four splits

### Tab Pane Splits

Tab pane splits can be any pane type.

- To create a tab pane split click the disclosure arrow to the upper right of any pane and choose `Split Pane Left/Right` (or `Top/Bottom`)
- `⌥[`: `Split Pane Left/Right`
- `⌥]`: `Split Pane Top/Bottom`

### Notes

- There's little arrow icons that can be hovered at the edges of the viewport that can be used to expand or collapse splits

## Tabs

Note in this context, "tab" is just the smaller panels, not the entire window

- `⌘W`: Close the current tab
- `⌘T`: Duplicate the current tab
- `⌘PgUp` / `⌘PgDn`: Next / previous tab
    - Also `⌘tab` / `⇧⌘tab`, which is of course useless and obnoxious because it conflicts with one of macOS's most common shortcuts
