# Houdini Window Management

Note in this context, "tab" is just the smaller panels, not the entire window

- `⌘W`: Close the current tab
- `⌘T`: Duplicate the current tab
- `⇧⌘PgUp` / `⇧⌘PgDn`: Next / previous tab
    - Also `⌘tab` / `⇧⌘tab`, which is of course useless and obnoxious because it conflicts with one of macOS's most common shortcuts
