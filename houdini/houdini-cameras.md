# Houdini Cameras

- To view through a camera, use the camera menu in the upper right of the viewport.

## Frustum

*View frustum is the region of space where the modeled world can appear on screen. Objects closer than the near plane or farther than the far plane are not drawn.*

The Camera Frustum can be seen for a selected camera with the `Show Handle` viewport button (or by hitting `↩` when the viewport has focus).

- While the handle is visible, hitting `F` will switch to the `Frustum Handle`, this can also be accessed by right-clicking the camera.

## New Camera

- Create a camera by clicking the `New Camera` in the camera pull-down menu in the upper right of the viewport.
- `⌘-click` the `Camera` icon in the toolbar to insert a camera based on the current view.

## Lock Camera

The lock icon in the `Display options` (toolbar to the right of the "3D Scene View") locks the view port to the camera, so that navigating the scene also moves the camera.
