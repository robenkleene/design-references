## Matte vs. Mask

- A *mask* is a shape applied to a layer that determines which part of the layer is visible, a mask is usually a vector, and usually animated manually
- A *matte* is an image that defines transparency from black (transparent) to white (opaque), matte's are usually raster images, and usually are generated

## Layer Masks vs. Clipping Masks

- A *layer mask* is added to a layer, it uses black to hide pixels, and white to show pixels
- A *clipping mask* controls visibility of one layer with the transparency of another
