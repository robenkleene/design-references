# Photoshop

- Photoshop iPad can't change the canvas size
- To remove objects, use the `Spot Healing Brush` tool.
- The little floating circle is the "Touch Shortcut", holding it will perform an alternate action with the current tool. E.g., the eraser with the brush tool. There's a second alternative tool by moving your finger again after tapping, e.g., the eye dropper for the brush tool.
