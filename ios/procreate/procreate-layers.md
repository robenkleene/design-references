# Procreate Layers

- To create a layer mask, tap the layer in the layers menu and select "Mask".
- To create a glow effect: Make a new layer, overlay blend style, use new color that's more saturated, reduce the opacity, and airbrush what you want to glow.
- To move a layer, select the layer and then tap the cursor icon in the upper-right (the transform) button, and then drag the selection box that appears to move the layer.
- To select multiple layers, swipe select the first one, then swipe right on each additional layer you want to select, this is also how you create groups of layers.

## Alpha

- `Alpha Lock`: Lock where transparency is, i.e., you can only paint over opaque pixels.
