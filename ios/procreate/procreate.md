There's also a hack for making a grid with a brush, choose the `Texture > Grid` brush and to paint the whole canvas without lifting your finger.

## Layers

- To create a layer mask, tap the layer in the layers menu and select "Mask".
- To create a glow effect: Make a new layer, overlay blend style, use new color that's more saturated, reduce the opacity, and airbrush what you want to glow.
- To move a layer, select the layer and then tap the cursor icon in the upper-right (the transform) button, and then drag the selection box that appears to move the layer.
- To select multiple layers, swipe select the first one, then swipe right on each additional layer you want to select, this is also how you create groups of layers.

## Canvas

- Turn on "Drawing Guide" to see graph paper
- Use "Edit Drawing Guide" -> "Symmetry" to make symmetrical patterns

## Quickshape

- To draw a straight line, dry a line and don't lift your finger until the line straightens.
- You can use this same technique to draw shapes like squares and circles.
- After creating a shape, you can tap "Edit Shape" to adjust it.
- Under "Gesture Control", in the gear menu, you can configure an option for re-editing the last quick shape.

## Animation

- Each layer is a frame
- "Animation Assist" can be turned on under the gear menu

## Symmetry

Symmetry is turned on under the wrench icon "Canvas > Drawing Guide" (which needs to be turned on), then "Canvas > Edit Drawing Guide" to configure it. Select "Symmetry", and choose from "Vertical", "Horizontal", Quadrant", and "Radial", and turn on "Assisted Drawing". "Assisted Drawing" needs to be toggled per layer, which can be toggled in the menu that pops up when you tap a layer's icon.
