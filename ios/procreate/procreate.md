## Grid

- Toggle on with `Actions > Canvas > Drawing Guide`
- Edit with `Actions > Canvas > Edit Drawing Guide`

### Hack

There's also a hack for making a grid with a brush, choose the `Texture > Grid` brush and to paint the whole canvas without lifting your finger.

## Quickshape

- To draw a straight line, dry a line and don't lift your finger until the line straightens.
- You can use this same technique to draw shapes like squares and circles.
- After creating a shape, you can tap "Edit Shape" to adjust it.
- Under "Gesture Control", in the gear menu, you can configure an option for re-editing the last quick shape.

## Animation

- Each layer is a frame
- "Animation Assist" can be turned on under the gear menu

## Symmetry

- Use `Edit Drawing Guide > Symmetry` to make symmetrical patterns

Symmetry is turned on under the wrench icon "Canvas > Drawing Guide" (which needs to be turned on), then "Canvas > Edit Drawing Guide" to configure it. Select "Symmetry", and choose from "Vertical", "Horizontal", Quadrant", and "Radial", and turn on "Assisted Drawing". "Assisted Drawing" needs to be toggled per layer, which can be toggled in the menu that pops up when you tap a layer's icon.
