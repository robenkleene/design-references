# Procreate Glow

1. Duplicate the layer to make glow and turn on `Alpha Lock` on the bottom copy.
2. Cover the bottom copy with a desaturated version of the color you want to use by selecting the color and choosing `Fill Layer`.
3. Toggle off the `Alpha Lock`, and add a `Gaussian Blur` adjustment to the layer (choose `Layer`). Swipe your finger to choose the amount.
4. Change the layer mode to `Color Dodge`
5. Tap the pointer to tool to move the glow to offset it some.
