# Figma Shapes

You can also simply cut and paste shapes from Illustrator into Figma. You'll probably want do `Object > Path > Outline Stroke` in Illustrator first so the path copies in nicely.

## Pen Tool & Vectors

Just hit return to enter vector edit mode (where you can move points).

Hold `⌘` to use the `Bend Tool`.

## Arrows

- `⇧L` for the arrow tool

### Tips

- Draw an arrow, then adjust its size by setting the stroke.
- To make it curved, enter vector edit mode by hitting enter, then using the Bend Tool by holding `⌘`.
