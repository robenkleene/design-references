# Figma Grid

- `⌃G`: Toggle grid visibility

## Creating

- To create a grid, select a frame, and under "Design" in the right sidebar, find "Layout Grid".
- To switch it to a layout grid, click the icon for the grid under "Layout Grid" and change "Grid" to "Column".

## 8pt Grid

- Set the nudge amount under "Preferences > Nudge Amount...", e.g., for `8pt` for an 8pt grid. Then `⇧` and arrow keys will move by the nudge amount.
- The majority of screen sizes are divisible by `8`, as is a `16pt` line height.
