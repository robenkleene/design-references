# Webflow

- `A`: Add Elements
- `⌘↩`: Add class

## Tips

- Hold `⌥` to move opposite margins or padding at once.
- Hold `⇧` to move all margins or padding at once.

## Dimensions

- `100vh`: Entering this as a height will cause it to match the viewport height.

## Typography

- Adding a hyphen, e.g., `1.4-` makes the setting "Unit-less", which means it scales with the font size.

### Base Font

1. Select the `Body` element.
2. In the class selector, choose `Body (All Pages)`.
3. Then change the font.

## Notes

- The eye dropper tool requires a browser extension.
