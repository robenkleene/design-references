# Blend Modes

- **Multiply**: Multiple the blend layer's color with the base layer. Use this to give the base layer a tint. Multiply always darkens.
- **Screen**: Like multiply, but lightens.
- **Overlay**: A combination of multiply and screen, it darkens darker areas and lightens lighter areas. It increases contrast.

Those are the major types of blend modes, normally there are other variations of those grouped together (e.g., in Photoshop).

## More

- **Normal**: No blending, just overlay.
- **Add**: Similar to lighten, but lighten takes the higher of the two values.
- **Screen**: Another lighten effect.
