# Exposure Value

Exposure Value (EV) is a number that normalizes a camera's shutter speed and f-number, a difference of 1 EV corresponding to a standard power-of-2 exposure step (a stop).

In 3D rendering, a camera and a light both usually have an EV setting, the camera's EV representing how sensitive the camera is, and the light's EV representing how strong the light is.
