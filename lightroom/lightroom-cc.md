# Adobe Lightroom CC

- `g`: Go to grid view (tap again to toggle between types of grid
- `d`: Go to detail view
- `i`: Show details about photo
- `\`: Toggle showing original (unedited) photo
- `j`: Show clipping

### Brushes

- To access the adjustment brush: Tap `Masking` (icon looks like a sunflower), then tap the plus sign and select brush.
    - Tap the brush icon to hide and show the affected area. Also to move the mask.
- `h`: Healing brush
- `[` / `]`: Decrease/increase brush size
- The "Auto Mask" checkbox makes the brush try to automatically detect boundaries, a bit like the "Magic Wand" tool in Photoshop.

### Eyedropper

To sample a color from your photo, hold the mouse button down in side the color overlay and then drag out of the overlay onto the photo.

## Mobile

- Tap and hold to compare to original photo
- Undo and redo arrows are near the top on iPad

## Creative Cloud Sync

If you delete a photo from Lightroom CC, it won't delete it from Lightroom Classic (because Lightroom Classic considers its library the source of truth).

## Tips

- Split Toning is under "Effects" -> "Split Toning".
- To edit in Photoshop, go to share, "Open In", "Copy to Photoshop", after finishing editing, tap "Publish and Export" and select Lightroom.

## Cyberpunk

1. Use "Color" -> "Temperature" tool, click on something white (the eye dropper sets the white balance based on choosing something in the photo that's a neutral color)
2. Use "Effects" -> "Split Toning", change the highlights in the photo to something blue, and the shadows to violet.
3. Decrease the highlights, increase the shadows
4. Increase the whites
5. Decrease the blacks
6. Use a brush that ups the highlights
