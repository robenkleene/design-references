## Focus

Tap `MF` to switch to manual focus, in manual focus mode, tap the icon on the left to enable focus peaking, which puts a border around the part of your photo that is in focus.

Use manual focus to have the subject of your photo in focus with the background blurred.

### Depth

In the depth mode, there are two buttons, one that enables portrait mode, and another that that shows the depth map.

After taking a shot with depth on, the depth can be manipulated in the Photos app.

## Exposure

- `EV`: Exposure value, essentially the brightness of a scene.

### Manual

- In manual mode, swipe up and down to change the shutter speed.
- Tap the `ISO` button to swipe left and right to also change the ISO.

## Automatic White Balance (AWB)

Adjusts the tint of your photo to match the light source.

## Manual Use Case Example: Photos at Dusk

Let's say you're taking a long exposure at dusk. Under normal circumstances, the system will never recommend 1/3 exposure speed. That's because you're holding your phone in your hand, and handheld long exposures will always be blurry. That means that in low-light the system has to boost its ISO, which adds noise.

If you want the best possible shot in low light, you:

1. Mount your phone on a tripod
2. Set ISO to its lowest setting
3. Increase the shutter speed until the exposure looks right

And since Halide will prioritize ISO when in manual mode, you can even tap-to-expose without having to fight with the ISO jumping around.
