## Focus

Tap `MF` to switch to manual focus, in manual focus mode, tap the icon on the left to enable focus peaking, which puts a border around the part of your photo that is in focus (it highlights the part of the photo that has the sharpest contrast).

Use manual focus to have the subject of your photo in focus with the background blurred.

### Depth

In the depth mode, there are two buttons, one that enables portrait mode, and another that that shows the depth map.

After taking a shot with depth on, the depth can be manipulated in the Photos app.

## Exposure

- `EV`: Exposure value, essentially the brightness of a scene.

### Histogram

Histogram is a graph of the colors in the photo, dark is on the left and light is on the right. You can read the histogram to know to give your photo more or less exposure. The lows, mids, highs, in the histogram also map to shodows, midtones, and highlights.

The best histogram rises gently on the left, rises in the middle, and drops on the right.

A histogram is used as a more reliable indicator of exposure relative to the LCD screen.

A high contrast photo, e.g., a silhouette, will have peaks at the low and high end with a dip in the middle.

Good exposure looks like mountains, a bad exposure looks like a cliff. The key is that everything that "falls off the cliff" is lost information, ideally that information should be captured and then the exposure should be adjusted in post if that's the effect you are going for.

### Manual

- In manual mode, swipe up and down to change the shutter speed.
- Tap the `ISO` button to swipe left and right to also change the ISO.

## Automatic White Balance (AWB)

Adjusts the tint of your photo to match the light source.

## Manual Use Case Example: Photos at Dusk

Let's say you're taking a long exposure at dusk. Under normal circumstances, the system will never recommend 1/3 exposure speed. That's because you're holding your phone in your hand, and handheld long exposures will always be blurry. That means that in low-light the system has to boost its ISO, which adds noise.

If you want the best possible shot in low light, you:

1. Mount your phone on a tripod
2. Set ISO to its lowest setting
3. Increase the shutter speed until the exposure looks right

And since Halide will prioritize ISO when in manual mode, you can even tap-to-expose without having to fight with the ISO jumping around.

## Tips

- Swipe on lens type to switch. E.g., up for telephoto and left for ultrawide
