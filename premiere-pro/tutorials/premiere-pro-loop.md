# Premiere Pro Loop

To create a seamless loop:

1. Split the clip using the `Razor Tool` (`C`)
2. Move the second half of the clip to different track and move it to the beginning.
3. Move the first half to the end overlappling slightly.
4. `âŒ˜`-click the keyframe line to add keyframes at the start and end of the overlapping section (if the keyframe line isn't visible, drag the scroll bar to the right of the clips to make the clips section taller until the keyframe line is visible).
5. The keyframes should be set to opacity by default, but if not, right-click the clip and choose `Show Clip Keyframes > Opacity > Opacity`. Drag down the second keyframe on the keyframe line to `0` to fade out the clip.
