# Premiere Pro Freeze Frame

Right-click the clip and select:

- **Add Frame Hold**: Split the clip at the playhead and replaces the remainder of the clip with a freeze frame of the current frame.
- **Insert Frame Segment**: Split the clip and insert a freeze frame between the two portions of the clip.
- You can also click the camera icon to export a frame which can optionally also be automatically imported into the project panel.

### Notes

- Keyframes do not work on "Frame hold", the easiest way to get around this is to export the frame and add it manually. You can export the frame without effects by selecting the original footage and exporting from the preview viewport. (Note that you can't drag the default file format `.dpx` into the timeline, so choose a different one.)
