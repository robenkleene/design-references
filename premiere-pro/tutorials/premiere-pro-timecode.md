# Premiere Pro Timecode

- Timecode is an effect, drag it from effects to a video to add it.
- To remove the symbol to the right, toggle off "Field Symbol".
- To make the timecode start from `0`, you sometimes have to set "Timecode Source: `Clip`"?

## Freeze a Timecode

1. Right-click the bin and select "New Item > Transparent Video..."
2. Add the transparent video to the timeline by dragging it
3. Add a timecode effect to the transparent video by dragging the effect onto the video
4. Nest the transparent video by right-clicking it and selecting "Nest..."
5. After the timecode effect has been nested, you can right-click the nested clip and select "Add Frame Hold", and use a freeze frame on the transparent video with the timecode.
