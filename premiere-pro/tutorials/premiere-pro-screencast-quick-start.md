# Premiere Pro Screencast Quick Start

The recommended resolution for YouTube is `16:9`.

1. Create a new project
2. "Project Panel > Reveal Project in Finder..."
3. Move the assets (e.g., video) next to the project file
4. Drag the video into the bin
5. Drag the video from the bin into the timeline, this creates a sequence. (Alternatively, right-click the bin area and select "New Item > Sequence...", `AVCHD 1080p30` is a good preset to choose, it's `16:9` / `1920x1080`. You can change the aspect ratio by right-clicking the sequence and selecting "Sequence Settings...")
6. Select the clip in the timeline then select "Effect Controls > Motion" and zoom out in the view panel to about `50%` to see the resizing controls. Resize appropriately.

## Export

1. `#M` / "File > Export > Media..."
2. Set the export location, select settings, and hit return, this will open "Adobe Media Encoder"
3. Hit return again when Adobe Media Encoder has started to start the rendering queue
