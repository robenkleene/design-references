# Premiere Pro Text

- `âŽ‹`: Finish editing

## Paragraph

- With a line of text, using the Selection tool (`V`) will resize the text itself.
- With paragraph text, using the Selection tool (`V`) will resize the text box.
- There's not way to switch text between the two methods, you need to make a new text box and copy the text over.

## Adding Text

1. (Click off of "Effect Controls > Motion" if it's selected)
2. Select the text tool (`T`)
3. Click where you want the text to appear (or click and drag to create paragraph text)
4. Set the font under "Effect Controls > Text"

## Centering

Center controls are on the right sidebar, "Essential Graphics > Align and Transform".

## Effects

Premiere has limited options for adding effects to text, a better method is to use Photoshop for text and then import the `psd` file into Premiere. You can do this and then continue to edit the Photoshop document and your changes will update live.
