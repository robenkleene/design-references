# Premiere Pro Audio

## Fade In / Out

1. Select the clip in the timeline
2. Drag an `Effects > Audio Transtions > Crossfade > Constant Power` effect to the beginning and end of the audio clip (Note you can only drag this to the beginning and end of the clip)
3. Change `Effect Controls > Custom Fade > Duration` to determine the duration, it defaults to one second (usually about `00:05` on the start and the end is the smallest amount that prevents audible clipping). (Alternatively, there are also just drag handles on the effect in directly in the timeline that can be moved to change the duration.)
