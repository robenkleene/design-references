# Premiere Pro Export

- `⌘M` / `File > Export > Media...`
- Clip lengths are automatic, e.g., the export will be until the media ends

## Quick Export

E.g., just for reference.

`H.264` / match source, medium bit rate

## Normal

E.g., for upload.

`AVCHD 1080p30` is a good preset to choose (because it's `16:9` / `1920x1080`)

## Steps

1. Select the sequence in the `Project` panel (this menu item does nothing if a sequence isn't selected) and hit `⌘M` (`File > Export > Media...`)
2. Select settings and hit return, this will open "Adobe Media Encoder"
3. Hit return again when Adobe Media Encoder has started to start the rendering queue

## Export Single Frame

1. With the `Program Monitor` selected, click the `Export Frame` (`⇧E`) button (camera icon) below the video preview
2. Remember to choose a path to export to
