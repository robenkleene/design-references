# Premiere Pro Export

- Clip lengths are automatic, e.g., the export will be until the media ends

## Quick Export

E.g., just for reference.

`H.264` / match source, medium bit rate

## Normal

E.g., for upload.

`AVCHD 1080p30` is a good preset to choose (because it's `16:9` / `1920x1080`)

## Steps

1. Select the sequence (this menu item does nothing if a sequence isn't selected) and hit `âŒ˜M` (`File > Export > Media...`)
2. Select settings and hit return, this will open "Adobe Media Encoder"
3. Hit return again when Adobe Media Encoder has started to start the rendering queue
