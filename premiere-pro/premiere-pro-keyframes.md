# Premiere Pro Keyframes

- The keyframes are in `Timeline View` you can hide and show it with the triangle at the far right of the `Effects Controls`.

## Tips

- If your animation "drifts", e.g., you have a keyframe and the animation continues unpredictably, especially after the last keyframe. The fix is probably to select the keyframe, right-click and set "Spatial Interpolation > Linear".
    - If the probably persists after this fix, try moving your keyframes, sometimes there are duplicates with the wrong settings hiding underneath.
