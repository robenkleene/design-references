## Scopes

### Waveform

Corrects for exposure.

The trace corresponds to the content of the video.

### RGB Parade

Corrects for white balance issues. It's similar to the waveform but broken out into the individual color channels. It good for spotting imbalances if the images is too cool or too warm, that will look like one channel elevated above the others.
