# Premiere Pro

## Timeline

- `âŒƒ-click-and-drag` the edge of a clip to increase its duration.

## Notes 


- Zoom is under "Effect Controls" add keyframes like After Effects
- You set the aspect ratio by right-clicking a sequence and selecting "Sequence Settings.."
- You can move and resize the video when "Motion" (or any child parameter) is selected in "Effect Controls".
- You can't zoom the monitor with the keyboard, but you can select from several zoom levels in the select box below the monitor.

## Freeze Frame

Right-click the clip and select:

- **Add Frame Hold**: Split the clip and replaces the remainder of the clip with a freeze frame of the current frame.
- **Insert Frame Segment**: Split the clip and insert a freeze frame between the two portions of the clip.
- You can also click the camera icon to export a frame which can optionally also be automatically imported into the project panel.

### Notes

- Keyframes do not work on "Frame hold", the easiest way to get around this is to export the frame and add it manually. You can export the frame without effects by selecting the original footage and exporting from the preview viewport. (Note that you can't drag the default file format `.dpx` into the timeline, so choose a different one.)
