### Paste

- The basic system for paste is to unselect all tracks (selected tracks are the ones where, the identifiers, e.g., `V1`, `V2`, etc... are highlighted) with `⇧-click`, then select just the track to paste to by clicking it.
- If more than one track are selected then pasting will go to the lowest track.
