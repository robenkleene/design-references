Using a combination of `j` / `l`, `←` / `→`, and `i`, `o`, `,` to make quick fine-grained edits.

## Editing

- `⌘K`: Split clip

## Paste

- The basic system for paste is to unselect all tracks (selected tracks are the ones where, the identifiers, e.g., `V1`, `V2`, etc... are highlighted) with `⇧-click`, then select just the track to paste to by clicking it.
- If more than one track are selected then pasting will go to the lowest track.

## Snap

- `s`: Toggle snap

## Looping

- In the viewport, there's a plus icon in the lower-right, you can use that to add the loop button.
