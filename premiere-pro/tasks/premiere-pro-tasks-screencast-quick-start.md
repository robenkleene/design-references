# Premiere Pro Screencast Quick Start

The recommended resolution for YouTube is `16:9`.

1. Create a new project
2. "Project Panel > Reveal Project in Finder..."
3. Move the assets (e.g., video) next to the project file
4. Drag the video into the bin
5. Create a sequence by right-clicking the bin area and choosing "New Item > Sequence...", `AVCHD 1080p30` is a good preset to choose (because it's `16:9` / `1920x1080`).
6. Drag the clip into the timeline
7. Select the clip in the timeline then select "Effect Controls > Motion" and zoom out in the view panel to about `50%` to see the resizing controls. Resize appropriately.

## Export

1. `#M` / "File > Export > Media..."
2. Set the export location, select settings, and hit return, this will open "Adobe Media Encoder"
3. Hit return again when Adobe Media Encoder has started to start the rendering queue
