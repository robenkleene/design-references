# After Effects Shape Layers Repeater

The Repeater repeats a shape layer.

- `Copies`: Choose the number of copies, by default, these will all appear on top of each other
- `Offset`: Offset the start of the copies (e.g., for a horizontal row of circles, this will change where the copies start relative to the original)
