# After Effects Clips

## Cutting Footage

1. `Edit > Split Layer` (`⇧⌘D`), at the beginning of the section to remove
2. `Edit > Split Layer` (`⇧⌘D`), at the end of the section to remove
3. `Edit > Clear` (`⌫`), with the layer to delete selected

## Reverse

- Right-click the clip and choose `Time > Time Reverse Layer` / `⌥⌘R`

## Freeze Frame

### Quick

Put the playhead where you want your freeze frame and right-click and select: 

- `Time > Freeze Frame`: Freeze the frame for *the whole duration of the clip*
- `Time > Freeze On Last Frame`: Freeze on the last frame and add to the clip length, you can then drag to increase the clip length

### Freeze a Specific Frame

Freeze frames in After Effects work just like any other keyframes using the `Time Remap` (`⌥⌘T`) property. So just create a keyframe that holds the time where you want to clip to freeze.

- Right-click the layer, and choose `Time > Enable Time Remapping` (`⌥⌘T`)
