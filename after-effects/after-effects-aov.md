"Arbitrary output variables", these are layers that include individual shading elements like reflections, refractions, global illumination, etc...

1. After importing a `PSD` file with `AOV` the layers will be under a `Layers` folder
2. Drag all the layers into the timeline
3. Set the blend mode to `Add` for all the layers, also try `Screen`

## Effects

- To apply effects to all the layers (instead of just a single layer), add an adjustment layer (`⌥⌘Y`)
