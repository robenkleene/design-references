# After Effects Tasks Import Image Sequence

From a new After Effects document, playing back an image sequence as an animation can quickly be done in two steps:

1. Choose `File > Import > File...`, then make sure `Sequence` is toggled on
2. From the `Project` panel, drag the imported image sequence onto the `New Composition` button
