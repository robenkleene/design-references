# After Effects Tasks Remove Spots

1. Select the layer and then choose `Animation > Track Motion`
2. Move the `Track Point 1` so the inner square contains the spot (to move the entire track point, click and drag inside the box [i.e., avoid clicking the path points or center indicator])
3. On the right sidebar, choose `Tracker > Analyze > (Play Button)` to analyze the track forward

To hide the track points in the viewport, choose `View: None` below the viewport
