# After Effects Reverse

To reverse an animation, just right-click the layer and choose `Time > Time-Reverse Layer` (`⌥⌘R`).

So to play an animation backwards then forwards, first duplicate it then reverse the duplicate.

To then combine the forward and reverse playback to a single layer, choose `Layer > Pre-compose...` (`⇧⌘C`).
