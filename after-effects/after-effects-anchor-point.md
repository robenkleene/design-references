# After Effects Anchor Point

The `Anchor Point` is the point a layer rotates around.

- `⌘⌥HOME` / `Layer > Transform > Center Anchor Point in Layer Content`: Center the anchor point on a layer
- To move a layer's `Anchor Point` without changing its position, use the `Pan Behind (Anchor Point) Tool` (`Y`)
