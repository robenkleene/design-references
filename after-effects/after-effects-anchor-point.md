# After Effects Anchor Point

- The `Anchor Point` is the point a layer will scale or rotate around
- `⌘⌥HOME` / `Layer > Transform > Center Anchor Point in Layer Content`: Center the anchor point on a layer (if when you move a layer, it's also changing shape, then you probably need to do this)
- To move the `Anchor Point` first switch to the `Pan Behind (Anchor Point) Tool` (`Y`), this allows moving the `Anchor Point` without changing the layer's position
