## Rectangle Tool

- Double-click the `Rectangle Tool` icon to fill the composition with a shape of that size.

## Pen Tool

- Hold `⌘` and hover a point to delete it
- Click a point to select the path, and then click on the end of a path to close it. (This doesn't appear to work, try selecting the path, hold `⌘` or `⌥` and clicking the ends of the path).

### Selecting Multiple Points
