# After Effects Tools

## Eyedropper

- Hit enter to select a color from another application (clicking will bring that application forward)

## Pen Tool

- Hold `⌘` and hover a point to delete it
- Click a point to select the path, and then click on the end of a path to close it. (This doesn't appear to work, try selecting the path, hold `⌘` or `⌥` and clicking the ends of the path).

### Selecting Multiple Points

- With the layer selected in the timeline, using the Selection Tool (`V`), first click the entire path (the points should become highlighted), then click anywhere except the path to draw a marquee and select points.
