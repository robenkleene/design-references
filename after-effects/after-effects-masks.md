# After Effects Masks

- `⌘T` or double-click: Bring up bounding box to transform a mask
- When scaling using the bounding box, hold `⌘` to scale from the center, and `⇧` to constrain proportions

## Creating

- When using the shape tool (e.g., `Rectangle Tool` or `Ellipse Tool`), if a layer is selected, a mask will automatically be created on that layer (otherwise a shape layer will be created)
