- `⌘T` or double-click: Bring up bounding box to transform a mask
- When scaling using the bounding box, hold `⌘` to scale from the center, and `⇧` to constrain proportions

## Creating

When drawing using the shape tools, e.g., `Rectangle Tool` or `Ellipse Tool`, if you're drawing over a solid layer, a mask will automatically be created.
