# After Effects Window Management

- `backtick`: Hide all other panels (e.g., only show focused panel)
- `⌘0`: Toggle between `Project` and `Effects Controls`
- `\`: Switch focus between layers and viewport (this can also go from the `Render Queue` back to layers)
- `⇧,` / `⇧.`: Switch between multiple open compositions (with the viewport focused [`\`])
- `⇧⌥⌘N`: Open a second viewer
- Click the lock icon in a viewer's tab to prevent it from being replaced
