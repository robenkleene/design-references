# After Effects Stroke Fill

- `‚å•LMB` `Fill` (or `Stroke`): Cycle through options `None`, `Solid Color`, `Linear Gradient`, `Radial Gradient`

### Gradient Fill & Stroke

- Gradient fill and stroke default to `Start Point: 0.0,0.0` and `End Point: 100.0,0.0`, this is relative to the `Size` of the shape, so to adjust how much of the shape if affected by the gradient range, change start and end points.
