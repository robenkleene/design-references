# After Effects Stroke Fill

- `âŒ¥LMB` `Fill` (or `Stroke`): Cycle through options `None`, `Solid Color`, `Linear Gradient`, `Radial Gradient`

## Stroke

### Width

Under `Layer Panel > Shape Layer > Contents > Path > Stroke`, `Wave` can vary the thickness of the stroke, and `Taper` changes the endpoints of the stroke.

## Gradient

- Gradient fill and stroke default to `Start Point: 0.0,0.0` and `End Point: 100.0,0.0`, this is relative to the `Size` of the shape, so to adjust how much of the shape if affected by the gradient range, change start and end points.
