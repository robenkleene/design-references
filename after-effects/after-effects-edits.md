# After Effects Edits

## Speed Up or Slow Down

1. Turn on `Frame Blending` for the composition and each track to change the speed of (it's the icon that looks like two pieces of film overlapping)
2. Right click the track and choose `Time > Enable Time Remapping`
3. Add key frames each spot you want to change the speed and either drag farther from the start to slow down or closer to speed up
