# After Effects Timeline

- `⇧⌥J`: Go to time
- `⌘F`: Search for properties

## Transport

- `⌃0`: Quickly preview playback
- `␣`: Play / Pause
- `⌥⌘→` `HOME` / `⌥⌘←` `END`: Go to the beginning or end of composition
- `⌘←` / `⌘→`: Forward or backward one frame
- `⇧⌘←` / `⇧⌘→`: Forward or backward ten frames
- Hold `⇧` when dragging the playhead to snap to keyframes
- The transport controls, e.g., `Play` / `Stop` / `Next Frame` / `Last Frame` are under the `Preview` panel

## Layers

- `[` / `]`: Set the current layers in or out point to the playhead
- `⌥[` / `⌥]`: Trim the current layers in or out point to the playhead (this will preserve keyframe positions)
- `⇧F3` (or click the graph icon above the layers list): Toggle graph editor
- `j` / `k`: Move to previous / next key frame
- `⌥`-Page Down / `⌥`-Page Down: Offset the start of the current layer by one frame backward / forward.

### Work Area

The Work Area is the portion that will loop if you hit play (in contrast to the Time Navigator, which is the entire duration of the composition).

- `b`: Set the beginning of the work area
- `n`: Set the end of the work area
- `⇧⌘X`: Trim the composition to the work area

### Glossary

- For some reason toggling the disclosure indicators is called "Twirling".

## Expressions

E.g., rotation `time * 5`

- `⌥-click` the stopwatch to immediately enter an expression

## Effects

You can copy and paste effects with `⌘C` and `⌘V`.

## Tips

- To edit properties on multiple layers at once: Use the search field above the properties list and search for the property you want to change, then select each one and change the value.
- To edit the numerical value of the duration for a layer, right-click the column title (e.g., on "Source Name"), and show the "Duration" column.
- To quickly trim the timeline to a particular length, move the playhead where you want the timeline to end and hit `N` to set the end of the work area, then `⇧⌘X` (`Composition > Trim Comp to Work Area`).
