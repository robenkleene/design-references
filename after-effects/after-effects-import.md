# After Effects Import

## Image Sequence

- Choose `File > Import > File...`, then make sure `Sequence` is toggled on

### Sequence Naming

For a sequence to be properly recognized, image names should end with four digits before the file extensions, for example:

```
My_Render_Setting-mp_i2_0000.psd
My_Render_Setting-mp_i2_0001.psd
```

## From Other Projects

You can't copy layers between projects, but you can import projects into other projects (via `File > Import > File...` then copy the layer from the imported project).
