# After Effects Importing

## Image Sequence

- Choose `File > Import > File...`, then make sure `Sequence` is toggled on

## From Other Projects

You can't copy layers between projects, but you can import projects into other projects (via `File > Import > File...` then copy the layer from the imported project).
