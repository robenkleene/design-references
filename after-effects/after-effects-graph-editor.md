# After Effects Graph Editor

There are two types of graphs, the value and speed graphs. The amount you adjust the handles is called "influence". 

## Tips

- The options icon (below the Graph Editor, it looks like a bulleted list) is where you switch between the value graph and speed graph.
- There are preset buttons for Easy Ease, Easy Ease In, and Easy Ease Out below the Graph Editor.
