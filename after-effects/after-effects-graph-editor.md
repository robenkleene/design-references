# After Effects Graph Editor

- `-`: Zoom out
- `=`: Zoom in

## Tips

- With some keyframes selected, you can choose an Easy Ease preset by choosing an option under "Animation > Keyframe Assistant".
- It's easy to just cut a point and paste it where the playhead is.
- There's a "Fit all graphs to view" button at the bottom to scale the view to fit the graphs.
- The options icon (below the Graph Editor, it looks like a bulleted list) is where you switch between the value graph and speed graph.
- There are preset buttons for Easy Ease, Easy Ease In, and Easy Ease Out below the Graph Editor.

## Dimensions

- Hover the cursor over a graph line to see what that line corresponds to (e.g., a position graph will have "X" and "Y" values).
- To get separate graphs for each axis, right-click a property and select "Separate Dimensions".

## Types of Graphs

There are two types of graphs, the value and speed graphs. The amount you adjust the handles is called "influence".
