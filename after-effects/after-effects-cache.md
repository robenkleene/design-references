# After Effects Cache

You can clear After Effects Cache under `After Effects > Preferences > Media & Disk Cache... > Empty Disk Cache...`

## Warning

`Your disk cache folder is on a drive that does not have enough available space to safely store the full amount specified in your preferences.`

This message appears when starting After Effects when the hard drive doesn't have as much space as the disk cache size specified `After Effects > Preferences > Media & Disk Cache... > Maximum Disk Cache Size`. The default maximum is `92 GB`.

This probably happens even when it seems like there's more available disk space because of how macOS optimizes storage.
