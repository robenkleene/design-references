# After Effects Energy Ball

1. Make a new composition with `1920x1080` and `10` second duration.
2. Create a new black `Solid` layer called `Sphere Noise`.
3. Apply a `Turbulent Noise` effect to the `Sphere Noise` layer (`Fractal Noise` also works well)
4. Under `Turbulent Noise`, set `Fractal Type: Turbulent Sharp`, and toggle on `Invert`. `‚å•LMB` on the `Evolution` stopwatch to add an expression and enter `time * 500` (scrub through the composition here and see how the noise changes).
