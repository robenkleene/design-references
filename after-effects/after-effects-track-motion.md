# After Effects Track Motion

- `Animation > Track Motion`

## Track Motion

- When track motion is activated, the layer panel is opened for the selected layer (e.g., instead of the composition, this is the same view that's opened when double-clicking a layer)
- With the layer panel open, there's a `View > Motion Tracker Points` shown below the viewport
- The motion tracker points will only be visible if the the `<layer-name> > Motion Trackers > <Tracker #>` is selected
