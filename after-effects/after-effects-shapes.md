# After Effects Shapes

- If a layer is selected, the shape will automatically mask that layer, otherwise it'll create a shape layer

## Resizing & Moving

- In the `Layers` panel, if the top-level layer is selected, the points around the shape will be filled in, and dragging the points (or anywhere on the layer) will move the layer
- If a child of the top-level layer `Contents` is selected, then the points will be white, and dragging the points will resize the layer

## Polygon

- Use `↑` / `↓` while dragging out a shape to increase / decrease the number of points

## Paths

- To convert a path to a Bézier Path (so that each point can be edited independently with the `Pen` [`G`] tool), right-click the path under `Contents` and choose `Convert To Bezier Path`
