# After Effects Trapcode Form Properties

- **Base Form**: The starting shape, "Box - Grid" is a square, "Sphere - Layered" is a sphere.
- **Size XYZ**: The surface dimensions that particles are distributed in.
- **Particles in X, Y**: The number of particles distributed in the size in the X and Y directions.
- **Particles in Z**: The number of particles in the Z direction. For the "Box - Grid" this is like a number of layers. For "Sphere - Layered" this setting changes to "Sphere Layers" and controls the number of layers explicitly.
