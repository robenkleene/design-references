# Trapcode Form

In Trapcode Form, hit `c` to change the 3D camera tool (switch from orbit to pan or zoom).

## Starting

1. Make a new composition
2. Right-click in timeline panel and choose "New" -> "Solid", and click "Make Comp Size"
3. Right-click the solid and add the Trapcode Form affect to it

## Tips

- Using blend mode "Add" overlapping particles brighten
- Fractal Field Affect Size is good for smoothing out pixels, especially when also using a high number of particles

## Gradients

- To remove a gradient stop, just drag it off, to add one double-click on the gradient.

## Blend Mode

- There's no longer a blend mode option under "Rendering", so instead make a separate layer and change the blend mode of the new layer.
- To set a blend mode, right-click a layer and select it under "Blending Mode". 

## Fractal Field

To make a nice fractal field as a starting point.

### Fractal Field

- **Affect Size:** 3
- **Displace:** 230

Then to go further:

### Particle

- **Size XYZ:** 80
- **Set Color:** Over X, choose a nice gradient

### Sphere 1

- **Strength:** 100
- **Radius:** 300
