# After Effects Trapcode Particular Flame Text

1. Make a new composition, `1920x1080`, `7` seconds long, `24` frames per second, called `Logo Source`, with a black background color
2. Add the text:

        THE
        VOLCANO ISLAND
        SEASON 2

    Use `Futura`, with `THE` and `SEASON 2` medium and `VOLCANO ISLAND` bold, center it in the composition and make it white.

3. Drag a metal texture into the layers panel below the text layer
4. In the layers panel, for the metal texture, change the `TrkMat` layer to `Alpha Matte "THE VOLCANO ISLAND SEASON 2"` (this cuts the layer out based on the alpha of the layer above it)
5. Add a `Color Correction > Curves` effect to the metal texture layer, and use it to darken and add contrast.
