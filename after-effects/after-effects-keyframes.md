# After Effects Keyframes

- `⌥P`: Add a position keyframe

## Tips

- You can always add a keyframe (e.g., to insert a keyframe at the same value) by clicking the diamond keyframe icon to the far left.
- Select all the keyframes and `⌥-drag` the first or last keyframe to scale them.
- To temporarily disable a keyframe, just add an expression by `⌥`-clicking the stopwatch.

## Keyframe Assistant

### Sequence Layers

Select layers, right-click "Keyframe Assistant > Sequence Layers..."

- **Duration**: The duration of the transition. E.g., to have a layer show for a second, and transition for half a second, start with the layers showing for two seconds, then set the duration to half a second (this means the last number in the time code should be frames per second `/ 2`).

#### Transition

- **Dissolve front layer**: Fade out the top layer, with the bottom layer full opacity
- **Cross Dissolve Front and Back Layers**: Fade out the top layer, while fading in the bottom layer
