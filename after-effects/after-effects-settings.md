# After Effects Settings

- `After Effects > Settings... > General`: Toggle off `Enable Home Screen` (this is the startup screen).
- `After Effects > Settings... > Scripting & Expressions...`: Toggle off `Warn User When Executing Files` (this shows a popup every time a script is executed)
- `HDTV 1080 29.97` makes a decent starting preset. It's `1920x1080`, and `~30fps`.
