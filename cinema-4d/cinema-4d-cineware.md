# Cinema 4D Cineware

The Cineware plugin can be buggy with After Effects (e.g., `Live Link` not working and multi-passes being incorrectly rendered), a good rule of thumb is in the `Options...`, set `Rendering` to use the version of Cinema 4D bundled with After Effects, and in `Editing` use the current version.
