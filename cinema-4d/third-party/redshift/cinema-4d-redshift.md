# Cinema 4D Redshift

## Faster Renders

- Redshift calls it's IPR view `RenderView`
- `Render Settings > Redshift > Advanced > Unified Sampling`: The higher the threshold the faster it will render but the more noise there will be
    - You can mediate the noise under  `Render Settings > Redshift > Basic > Denoising`
    - Uncheck `Random Noise Pattern` to get rid of noise-related flickering during animation
