# Cinema 4D Install

- You can easily install old versions from the [Maxon Downloads page](https://www.maxon.net/en/downloads) for Redshift, or the [Knowledge Base](https://support.maxon.net/hc/en-us/articles/5091942997404-Where-can-I-download-the-previously-released-updates-builds-of-Cinema-4D) for Cinema 4D. After installing, it will overwrite the current version and you'll be able to upgrade again any time via Maxon app.
- Having out of sync versions of Redshift and Cinema 4D often causes problems
