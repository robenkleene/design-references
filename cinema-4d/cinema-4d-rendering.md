# Cinema 4D Rendering

- `⌘R`: Render view
- `⇧R`: Render to `Picture Viewer`

## Saving

- The default render view (i.e., without Redshift) does not provide an IPR (interactive preview render)
- To save a render as an image, just render to the `Picture Viewer` (`⇧R`) then use `File > Save Image as...` (`⌘⇧S`) to save it to a file

## Frames

- To render just the current frame, set `Render Settings > Output > Frame Range: Current Frame`
