# Cinema 4D Modeling

- `E`: Move
- `R`: Rotate
- `T`: Scale
- `↩`: Switch between `Points`, `Edges`, `Polygons`
- `␣`: Switch between most recent selection tool and modeling tool
- `⇧⌘A`: Is supposed to deselect all but doesn't work, only way to deselect in object is to click empty space in the Object Manager

## Tips

- An easy way to create a rounded cube is to check `Object > Fillet` and set the `Fillet Radius` and `Fillet Subdivision`

## Modeling

- By default, most Cinema 4D objects are not editable because they are parametric. To convert them to an editable object, choose `Tools > Convert > Make Editable` (`C`)
- Snapping icon is along the top toolbar
