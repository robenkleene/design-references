# Cinema 4D Settings

- `Units > Hexadecimal`: Enable hexadecimal in the color picker (doesn't seem to show up in the color picker itself, but if there's a disclosure triangle around the color property, look for the `#` to see the hexadecimal value)

## Cinema 4D Light

- There used to be an option to disable the `Quick Start Dialog` under `Preferences > Communication`, but it appears to be missing now. (This might be a restriction on the "Lite" and trial versions.)

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Window > Customization > Command Manager`, `â‡§F12`: Customize keyboard shortcuts
