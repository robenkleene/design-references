# Cinema 4D Settings

## Interface

- Toggle off `Interface > Show Mac Menu Bar` to instead show the menu bar in the Cinema 4D window (the Cinema 4D menu bar is so long that macOS ends up distorting the fonts to fit it in, and all the menu bar items on the right are inaccessible)

### Customization

- The menu bar can also be customized to hide certain menu items, but in practice this isn't stable and causes Cinema 4D to fail to launch

## Units

- `Units > Hexadecimal`: Enable hexadecimal in the color picker (doesn't seem to show up in the color picker itself, but if there's a disclosure triangle around the color property, look for the `#` to see the hexadecimal value)

## Cinema 4D Light

- There used to be an option to disable the `Quick Start Dialog` under `Preferences > Communication`, but it appears to be missing now. (This might be a restriction on the "Lite" and trial versions.)

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Window > Customization > Command Manager`, `â‡§F12`: Customize keyboard shortcuts
