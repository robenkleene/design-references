## Saving Projects With Assets



## Databases

- Databases are managed from the `Database` panel opened by clicking the icon in the upper right above the `Asset Browser`

### Connecting

- To connect a database, choose `Database > Connect Database...` from the `Databases` panel

### Adding Assets

- To add assets to a database, just drag the assets to the `Databases` panel (you'll be prompted for which database to add them to, and for setting metadata)
- After dragging the asset to the database, it seems to also require right-clicking it and choosing `Copy to Database...` to actually save the material to the database

### Searching

- In the `Databases`, databases have an eye icon next to them for whether to show assets from the database in the `Asset Browser`
