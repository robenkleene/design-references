## Dope Sheet

To make it easier to move keyframes (e.g., to swap some keyframes at the beginning of a scene for those at the end) it can be helpful to toggle on the `Timeline (Dope Sheet)`.

This will bring up a version of the timeline with a keyframe hierarchy on the right where all the keyframes for a particular object and of a particular type (e.g., rotation) can all be edited at once.
