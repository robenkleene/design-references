# Cinema 4D Animation

## Curves

"Window > Timeline (F-Curve)..."

## Notes

- To set the easing curve for a property, right-click the label for that property and select "Animation > Show F-Curve"
- A solid red dot means the current frame is a keyframe for this parameter
- A hollow red dot means there is a keyframe for this parameter but it's not the current frame
- To set a key frame, for the current frame for an individual parameter: If there's already an existing keyframe, first delete it, then set the value, then click the dot next to the value.
