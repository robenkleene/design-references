# Cinema 4d Pyro

- `Blackbody`: A method of simulating light and heat based on physics. Cooler temperatures emit red or orange colors, hotter temperatures emit white or bluish light.
- There doesn't seem to be a way to make the pyro simulation start on an earlier frame

## Changing the Fire Simulation Color

The color of the flame can be adjusted by choosing `Scatter > Channel > temperature`, and then adjusting the `Tint`.
