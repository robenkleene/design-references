# Cinema 4D Viewport

- `PgUp`: Toggle active view (toggle the four direction panels, note the viewport needs to be focused)
- `⇧V`: Toggle view settings
- On each viewport you can choose between `Top`, `Bottom`, `Perspective`, etc... under `Cameras`.

## Grid

- Toggle the grid under view settings (`⇧V`), `Filter`, `Workplane`

## Shading

To switch between shading and wireframes.

- `N A` / `Display > Gouraud Shading`: Gouraud Shading
- `N G` / `Display > Lines`: Lines

## Troubleshooting

- If the little camera indicator at the top of the viewport is missing, that might be because the wrong panel is selected. Try choosing `Panel > View 1`.
