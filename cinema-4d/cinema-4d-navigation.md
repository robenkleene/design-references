# Cinema 4D Navigation

- `View > Frame Default` reset/re-align view
- Hold shift to move snapped increments

## Mouse

- `⌥LMB`, `3+LMB`: Orbit around focus
- `⌥⌘LMB`: Orbit around origin
- `⌥MMB`, `1+LMB`: Pan
- `⌥RMB`, `Scroll Wheel`, `2+LMB`: Zoom

## Trackpad

Probably better to use the numbers because they're better supported.

- `1+LMB`, `Two-Finger-Drag`: Pan
- `2+LMB`, `⌥Two-Finger-Click-Drag` (note this needs to actually *click*, which is weird for a two-finger gesture), `Pinch`: Zoom
- `3+LMB`, `⌥One-Finger-Click-Drag`: Orbit around focus
