# Cinema 4D Troubleshooting

- If you have a small circle following your cursor around, that's probably the `Brush Selection` tool. Switch to another tool to get rid of it, the default tool is the `Move` tool (`E`).
- If there's a red border around the viewport, then `Autokeying` might be turned on, there's an icon that looks like a red circle around a pause button that turns it off in the transport controls (or `âŒ˜F9`). When `Autokeying` is toggled off, the icon is a circle around an A.
