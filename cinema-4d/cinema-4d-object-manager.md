# Cinema 4D Object Manager

- : , red means off, green means on. Hold `⌥` when clicking to change both dots at once


- To duplicate an object, just use `⌘C` then `⌘V`
- `S`: Scroll to first active in object manager
- Objects colored purple will manipulate or distort objects or data
- Deformers need to be children of object to deform
- Deformer properties have a `fit to parent` that sizes to parent
- Hold shift with an object selected in the object manager when adding an object to add it as a child

## UI

- The square to the left of the dots is the layer (a grey square with a slash through it means the object doesn't belong to any layer)
- The green check mark toggles the object on or off (non-parametric, i.e., "editable", objects do not have this green check mark)
