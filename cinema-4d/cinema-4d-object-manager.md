# Cinema 4D Object Manager

- To duplicate an object, just use `⌘C` then `⌘V`
- `⌥G`: Wrap current selection in a `null`
- `S`: Scroll to first active in object manager
- Objects colored purple will manipulate or distort objects or data

## Create

- Hold `⇧` to add an object as a child
- Hold `⌥` to add an object as the parent (note that if multiple objects are selected, a parent will be added to each object in the selection, i.e., instead of one parent for several children)

## UI

- The square to the left of the dots is the layer (a grey square with a slash through it means the object doesn't belong to any layer)
- The green check mark toggles the object on or off (non-parametric, i.e., "editable", objects do not have this green check mark)

### Visibility Dots

The two dots to the right of an object name change it's visibility.

- **Top:** Workspace
- **Bottom:** Renderer
- Red means off, green means on, hold `⌥` when clicking to change both dots at once

#### Dot Colors

- **Grey:** Inherit from parent
- **Red:** Off
- **Green:** On
