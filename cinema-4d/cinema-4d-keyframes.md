# Cinema 4D Keyframes

- `^F` / `^G`: Go to previous / next keyframe

## Key

For the circles next to values:

- Grey filled in: Value isn't animated
- Red empty circle: Animated value from a different keyframe
- Red filled in: Keyframe on this frame
- Yellow empty: Current value doesn't match animated value (it will automatically change if you leave this key frame, this happens if you toggle off a keyframe for a value)
