# Cinema 4D Instances

## Creating Instances

1. Select the base object in the `Object Manager`
2. Choose `Subdivision Surface (icon on the right side, looks like cube points with a circle inside) > Instance`
3. With the instance selected, with the `Object Manager` selected, `Attributes > Object` allows choosing the different instance types (e.g., `Instance`, `Render Instance`, or `Multi-Instance`)
