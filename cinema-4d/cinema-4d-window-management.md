# Cinema 4D Window Management

- `Panel > New View Panel`: Create a new floating window
- The `Cameras` menu has the various camera options like `Perspective`, `Top`, etc...
- Views, these are actually four different views that can be configured to be different camera views, the below are just the defaults
    - `F1`: Default camera
    - `F2`: Perspective
    - `F3`: Right
    - `F4`: Front

## Splits

- `Panel > Arrangement`: Choose a split view setup
- It's not clear whether there's another way to close a view besides choosing another option under `Panel > Arrangement`
- `F5` / `Toggle Active View` (icon in upper right of viewport): Toggle between a split view and a single active view
- Split the viewport into four quadrants by clicking the icon in the upper right (`Panel > All Views` or `F5`)
- The four quadrant views can be switched to directly with `F1` through `F4` (or choose a view from the `Panel` menu)

### Side-by-Side Preview

#### Normal Way

To setup a window for editing and another beside it showing a preview.

1. `Panel > Arrangement > 2 Views Side-by-Side`
2. `Cameras > Parallel` in the new view
3. Make the new view a preview (e.g., `Redshift > Start IPR` in the new view)

#### Fastest Way

1. `⇧C` `2 view`
2. `⇧C` `parallel`
3. `⇧C` `ipr`

## Docking Windows

- To dock a window, click and drag the hamburger icon
- To undock, click the hamburger icon and choose `Undock`

## Tabs

There's no built-in keyboard shortcuts to switch tabs, the commands are `Next Project` / `Previous Project`

## Bottom Manager

- `⇧W`: Close bottom manager view
