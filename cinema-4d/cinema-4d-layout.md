# Cinema 4D Layouts

- A `Layout` is a collection of `Palettes`

## Layout

- A new `Layout` can be created by choosing the three dots in the upper right of the window and choosing `Save Layout as...`
- User layouts are shown to the right of the built in layouts across the top of the window

## Palettes

### Creating

1. Create a `Palette` under `Window > Customization > New Palette`
2. Add items to a palette by opening `Window Customization > Command Manager` (`⇧F12`)
3. Search for the item to add, then drag it into the palette

### Positioning

- By default, palettes appear as floating windows, but they can be dragged anywhere into the interface by dragging the grab handles

## Adding to Toolbar

To add the icon to a toolbar, just choose `Window > Customization > Command Manager` (`⇧F12`), search for the name of the script, then drag it out over a toolbar to add an icon.
