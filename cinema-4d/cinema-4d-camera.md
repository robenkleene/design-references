# Cinema 4D Camera

## Built-In Cameras

- `Cameras` menu has the following options:
    - `Perspective`
    - `Left`
    - `Right`
    - `Front`
    - `Back`
    - `Top`
    - `Bottom`
- Only the `Perspective` camera has `Display > Gouraud Shading` turn on by default, that's why the other cameras sometimes look like just wireframes and only the `Perspective` camera has shading.

## Create

- `Create > Camera > Standard`
- To view through a created camera, click the icon in the Object Manager that looks like a target for the camera.

## Tags

- `Rigging Tags > Protection`: Prevent the camera from being moved
