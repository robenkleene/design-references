# Cinema 4D Camera

## Create

- `Create > Camera > Standard`
- To view through a created camera, click the icon in the `Object Manager` that looks like a target for the camera

## Camera Views

`Cameras` menu has the following options:

- `Perspective`
- `Left`
- `Right`
- `Front`
- `Back`
- `Top`
- `Bottom`

Only the `Perspective` camera has `Display > Gouraud Shading` turn on by default, that's why the other cameras sometimes look like just wireframes and only the `Perspective` camera has shading.

## Default Camera

To see the coordinates of the default camera, choose `Cameras > Show Camera Attributes`.

## Tags

- `Rigging Tags > Protection`: Prevent the camera from being moved

## Lock

- Right-click and add the `Rigging Tags > Protection` to the `Camera` to prevent it from being moved

## Center Camera

1. `Commander > Reset Transform (Reset PSR, Reset PSR)`
2. Only set the `P.Z` to position the camera

## Lens Effects

By default, these are controlled under `RS RenderView > Settings`, but can be enabled per camera instead here.
