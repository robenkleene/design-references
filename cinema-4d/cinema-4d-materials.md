# Cinema 4D Materials

- `⇧F2` / `Material Manager...`: Open the material manager
- Double-click in the `Material Manager` panel to create a new material
- To open the material attributes, click the material tag to the left of it in the `Object Manager`
- To open the `Node Editor` without going through the `Material Manager`, use `Open Material in Node Editor` from the `Commander...` (`⇧C`)

## Applying a Material to a Selection

1. Create a `Polygon Selection` by using the `Polygons` mode (`↩` to switch between modes, an `Edge Selection` will not work)
2. Choose `Select > Sets > Store Selection`
3. Right-click the material and choose `Apply`

## Notes

- Multiple materials can be applied to the same object, the materials are just layered on top of each other
