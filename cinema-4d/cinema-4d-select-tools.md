# Cinema 4D Select Tools

- `9` / `Brush Selection`: Useful for interactively selecting an entire face of many polygons (e.g., to extrude a face of complex geometry, use brush selection to select all the polygons that make up the face, then use the `Inset` tool [`M W`] to make a smaller version of the face, then the `Extrude` tool [`M T`] to just extrude that smaller version)
