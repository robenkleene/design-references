# Cinema 4D Redshift

`Redshift` does not appear in the tool bar by default, in order to show it `Preferences > Renderer > Redshift` needs to be enabled *and* `Render Settings > Renderer: Redshift` needs to be set.

Once `Redshift` has been selected as the renderer, the `Redshift RenderView` can be shown by clicking the picture viewer button.
