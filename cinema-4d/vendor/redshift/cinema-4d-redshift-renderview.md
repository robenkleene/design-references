# Cinema 4D Redshift RenderView

## Settings

- The `Settings` are accessed on the far right gear icon button (the window needs to be quite large for the icon to be visible)
- The `General` section has the important setting for `Apply to non-beauty AOVs`, this is especially important if any artistic effects (like `Bloom` or `Flare`) are applied
- Settings includes sections for `LUT`, `Color Controls` (e.g., `Contrast` and curves), `Bloom`, `Flare`, `Streak`, `Denoise`, `Magic Bullet Looks`
