# Cinema 4D Redshift Node Editor

- `c`: Create a node (to select the first node, just hit enter, no need to use the down arrow to highlight the first match first)
- To select an input on a node that isn't visible by default, drag the connection cable anywhere on the node and a menu will pop-up to choose any input for that node
- `C` `Open Material in Node Editor`

## Navigation

- Two-finger drag pans by default, if this isn't working, it might be because you're really on the `Redshift Shader Graph`
