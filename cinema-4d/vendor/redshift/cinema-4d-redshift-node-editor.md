# Cinema 4D Redshift Node Editor

- `C` / `double-click` canvas: Add node (double-clicking the canvas can be better because it means you don't have to worry about focus)
- `L` / `â‡§L`: Arrange selected / all nodes

## Zoom

- `H`: Frame all nodes
- `S`: Frame selected nodes

## Inputs & Outputs

- To select an input on a node that isn't visible by default, drag the connection cable anywhere on the node and a menu will pop-up to choose any input for that node

## Navigation

- Two-finger drag pans by default, if this isn't working, it might be because you're really on the `Redshift Shader Graph`
