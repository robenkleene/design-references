# Cinema 4D Redshift Shader Graph

The `Redshift Shader Graph` is an older way of creating Redshift materials that was replaced by the `Node Editor`.

- Hold `1`, and one finger click and drag to pan
- There are two ways to add nodes, either by right-clicking or by dragging from the sidebar. These two places seem to have different nodes available as well.

## Sidebar Nodes

### Color

- `Color Correct`: Allows changing the hue, saturation, and contrast

### Texture

- `Ramp`: Ramp
