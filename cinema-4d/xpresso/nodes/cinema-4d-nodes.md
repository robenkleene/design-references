# Cinema 4D Nodes

- `Degree`: Convert from radians to degrees or vice-versa (note this doesn't support vectors, so the three values need to be converted separately)
- `Hierarchy`: Iterate through a list of ancestors
- `Mix`: Transition between two values
- `ObjectList`: Iterate through a list of objects
- `Range Mapper`: Scale between two ranges of values (e.g., `0-90` frames to `0-1`)
- `Result`: Show the result of a calculation live in the XPresso editor, e.g., for debugging
