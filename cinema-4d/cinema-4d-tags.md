# Cinema 4D Tags

- Tags add properties or attributes to an object
- Information about specific tags can be viewed or edited in the `Attribute Manager` (the properties panel, just select the tag after it's applied to an object)
- You can add a tag by using the `Commander...` (`â‡§C`) to search for it and select it, the tag will be applied to the select object(s)

## Tags

- `Rigging Tags > Protection`: Prevent an object from being moved
- `Animation Tags > Target`: Keep an object (e.g., camera or light) pointed at another object
