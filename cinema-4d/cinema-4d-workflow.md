1. Add lighting and an (optional) backdrop (this is done first so we don't spend time adjusting materials to match the default lighting setup and then have to redo them when we add our final lighting)
2. Modeling
3. Materials
4. Lens Effects (either per camera under `RS Camera` or globally under `RS RenderView > Settings`). Make sure to enable `Apply to non-beauty AOVs`)
4. Magic Bullet Looks
5. Setup AOVs
6. Render
