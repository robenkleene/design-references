# Cinema 4D Tasks Spotlight Rays

1. Add an `RS Environment`
2. That might make the scene all white, if so reduce the `RS Environment > Volume Scattering > Ray Contribution Scales > Camera`
3. Reducing the exposure of the main light, and upping the exposure of the spotlight,
can help the rays be more visible
