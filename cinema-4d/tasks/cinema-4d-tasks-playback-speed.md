# Cinema 4D Tasks Playback Speed

How to make a scene playback faster or slower.

1. Open `Edit > Scene Settings` (`⌘D`), this will open the `Scene Settings` in the `Attributes` panel
2. Set `Project > Time > FPS`, the higher the FPS the slower the scene will playback
3. To keep the scene the same duration, change the timeline to end at the original frames
4. Check the `Render Settings` (`⌘B`) and make sure the number of frames matches there too
