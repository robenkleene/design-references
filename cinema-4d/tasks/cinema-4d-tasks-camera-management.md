# Cinema 4D Tasks Camera Management

1. Set the render camera as the active camera (click the white camera icon next to it in the `Object Manager`)
2. Switch to `Panel > View 2` (`F2`, `Viewport > Panel > View 2`, or middle mouse button click once to see four views, and middle mouse button click on view two)
3. Set `Viewport > Cameras > Perspective` and `Viewport > Display > Gouraud Shading` (to use the same settings as `View 1`)
4. Just work in `View 2` and rendering should always pick up the render camera (e.g., after `Add to Render Queue...`)
