# Cinema 4D Glossary

## HPB

Cinema 4D's coordinates system uses "heading", "pitch", and "bank".

- **Heading**: Bank is relative to the object.
- **Pitch**: Pitch is up/down rotate (like nodding your head "yes").
- **Bank**:  Rotation along the center axis.

Rotations around the Z-axis (Bank), use the object system, whereas rotations around the Y and X axes (heading and pitch) use the world system.

The HPB system is an Euler system where the HPB angles do not refer in principle to the axes of the object itself.
