# Cinema 4D

What feels the most natural are two-finger drag to pan, `⌥drag` to orbit, and `2drag` to zoom (the last two with three-finger drag on touch pad).

- `⌥drag`: Rotate (orbit) the camera around a point
- Two-finger drag up and down: Zoom in and out
- `Hold 1 + click-and-drag`: Pan
- `Hold 2 + click-and-drag`: Zoom
- `Hold 3 + click-and-drag`: Orbit
- `e`: Move
- `r`: Rotate
- `t`: Scale
- Hold shift to move snapped increments

The three icons in the upper right of the main view do orbit, pan, and zoom.

## Trackpad

- `⌥-2-finger` to orbit
- `⌥-3-finger` to pan

## Tools

### Move

- If the yellow scaling handles are missing, select "Tools" -> "Modes" -> "Model"

## Materials

## Image Viewer

You can open a reference image by going to "Window" -> "Picture Viewer", using the folder icon to open an image, and then dragging the grid icon in the upper left of the window into the sidebar.
