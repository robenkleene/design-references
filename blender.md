# Blender

- `A`: Add object
- `TAB`: Swap between object and edit modes
- `S`: Snap menu, primarily works with the 3D cursor
- `x`: Delete object
- `⌘click`: Select object

## Movement

- `two-finger-drag` or `⌥-drag`: To orbit (or drag on the multi-colored gizmo in the upper right of the work area)
- `⇧-two-finger-drag` or `⇧-⌥-drag`: To pan (or drag on the hand it the upper right of the work area)
- `⌃-two-finger-drag` or `⌃-⌥-drag`: zoom (or drag on the magnifying glass in the upper right of the work area)

### Strategy

Use `⇧`, `⌃`, and unmodified two-finger drag to pan, zoom, and orbit.

### Scroll Direction

Blender doesn't play nice with the "Scroll direction: natural" enabled, so turn it off when using Blender. With it off and "Natural Trackpad Direction" enabled in Blender, scrolling works naturally: Panning left moves left, zooming up zooms in, and orbiting up flies up.

## Modes

- `⇧␣`: Bring up mode selector

### Switching Modes

When the mode selector is visible, use these shortcuts to change modes.

- `␣`: Cursor

The following can also just be hit directly to immediately start doing the corresponding action:

- `g`: Move ("grab")
- `r`: Rotate
- `s`: Scale
- `b`: Select

Once one of the above actions is attached, tapping the corresponding axis letter, e.g., `z`, `x`, or `y` will lock the movement into that axis.

Right-click or `ESC` cancels any of the above actions.

### Middle Mouse Button

A middle mouse button tap can be used to lock the manipulation into a particular action. The sequence looks like:

1. Tap a manipulation shortcut, e.g., `g` to move
2. Move the mouse slightly in the correct axis
3. Hold `⌥` and tap to lock it into that axis

With "Edit" > "Preferences" > "Input" > "Emulate 3 Button Mouse" enabled, hold `⌥` to emulate a three button mouse.

## 3D Cursor

- `S`: Provides the snap menu, where you can do actions like moving the 3D cursor to the origin, and moving the object to the 3D cursor.

## Transformations

- `g`: Move
- `s`: Scale
- `r`: Rotate

Hold `⌃` for snap mode.

## Glossary

- **Manipulator**: The controls to manipulate objects.
- **3D Cursor**: The 3D crosshairs.

## Focus

- `numpad .` / `View > Frame Selected`: Focus the selected object
- `backtick` Also has a way to "View Selected", with an `s` key shortcut
