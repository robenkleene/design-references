# 3D

- **Particle Advection**: Particles that have a particular force applied to them.
- **HDRI** ("High-Dynamic-Range Image"): Panoramic photograph that covers the entire field of vision and can be used to emit light into a CG scene. A regular photo stores much less data per pixel (32 bits vs. 8 bits). So to light a 3D scene, you want a larger range of brightness.
