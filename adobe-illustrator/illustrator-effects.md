# Illustrator Effects

## Transparency & Effects

Effects, as well as setting transparency, is done in the "Appearance" panel, under "View" -> "Appearance"

The appearance panel can be shown with the ellipses in the bottom right of the "Properties" panel

If you don't see your effects under appearance, you probably need to click the disclosure triangles next to "Fill" and "Stroke".
