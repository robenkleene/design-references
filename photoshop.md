## Selection

- Hold shift to transform without scaling.

## Settings

- Disable "Window" -> "Application Frame"
- Set everything to pixels in "Preferences" -> "Units & Rules"
- In the right sidebar, drag out most of the tabs, just leave swatches and layers
- Under "Edit" -> "Color Settings", set color settings to `sRBG`, for a conflict, ask when opening or pasting
