# Illustrator Tools Mesh

- To add a point, with the `Mesh Tool` selected, click somewhere not already occupied by a point (the cursor will show a `+`)
- To delete points, if they are points added by the mesh tool, then they can be delete by holding `‚å•` and hovering over them. If they are points created by another tool (e.g., the Warp or Wrinkle tool), then they can be deleted by selecting them with the `Direct Selection Tool` and then hitting backspace.
