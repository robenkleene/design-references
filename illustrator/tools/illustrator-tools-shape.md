# Illustrator Tools Shape

- Use `⌥` to draw a shape from the center as opposed to the edge, this can be combined with `⇧` to constrain proportions.

## Rounded Rectangles

Turn on "View" -> "Show Corner Widget" then hover near a corner with the "Direct Selection Tool" (`A`), a circle should appear that can be dragged to change the corner radius.
