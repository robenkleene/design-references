# Illustrator Gradients

If the gradient tool is unusable, that's probably because it's in Stroke mode, bring up the Gradient window with "Window > Gradient" (`⌘F9`), then click the fill to bring it forward.

## Tips

- To easily change the color of the stops, just select the stop and then click a color in the separate Color panel (`F6`).

## Complex Sets of Objects

To apply a gradient to a complex set objects that includes strokes and text, those objects first need to be expanded:

1. "Object > Expand Appearance"
2. "Object > Expand"
3. "Window > Pathfinder" (`⇧⌘F9`) "Pathfinder: Merge"
4. Clean up messy paths by selecting each object individually and doing the same "Pathfinder: Merge" command
5. "Object > Compound Path > Make" (`⌘9`)
