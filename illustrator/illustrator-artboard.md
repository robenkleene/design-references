# Illustrator Artboard

- Edit the artboard either by selecting "File" -> "Document Setup..." or just by clicking "Edit Artboard" in the "Properties" panel

## Background Color

### Simulate Colored Paper

You can give an artboard a background color by going to "File > Document Setup..." (or "Document Setup" in the Properties panel when nothing is selected)., turning on "Simulate Colored Paper", then changing the background color with the top color well. Strangely, the background color doesn't immediately update, but it does update if you enter and then exit Artboard Editing Mode (`â‡§O`, or select "Edit Artboard" from the Properties panel, then `ESC`).

### Layer

You can of course also just make a layer the same size as the artboard and use that to make a background. This approach has a couple of advantages:

1. The preview updates live, rather than having to select a color
