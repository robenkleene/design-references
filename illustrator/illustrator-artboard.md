# Illustrator Artboard

- Edit the artboard either by selecting "File" -> "Document Setup..." or just by clicking "Edit Artboard" in the "Properties" panel

## Background Color

You can give an artboard a background color by going to "File > Document Setup..." (or "Document Setup" in the Properties panel when nothing is selected)., turning on "Simulate Colored Paper", then changing the background color with the top color well. Strangely, the background color doesn't immediately update, but it does update if you enter and then exit Artboard Editing Mode (`â‡§O`, or select "Edit Artboard" from the Properties panel, then `ESC`).
