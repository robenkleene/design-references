# Illustrator Tools

- `⌥Click`: Get to tool settings (e.g., change number of vertices in the polygon tool)

## Shape Tools

- Use `⌥` to draw a shape from the center as opposed to the edge, this can be combined with `⇧` to constrain proportions.

## Rounded Rectangles

Turn on "View" -> "Show Corner Widget" then hover near a corner with the "Direct Selection Tool" (`A`), a circle should appear that can be dragged to change the corner radius.

## Mesh Tool

- To add a point, with the `Mesh Tool` selected, click somewhere not already occupied by a point (the cursor will show a `+`)
- To delete points, if they are points added by the mesh tool, then they can be delete by holding `⌥` and hovering over them. If they are points created by another tool (e.g., the Warp or Wrinkle tool), then they can be deleted by selecting them with the `Direct Selection Tool` and then hitting backspace.

## Type

- `⇧⌘>` / `⇧⌘>`: Increase / decrease font size
