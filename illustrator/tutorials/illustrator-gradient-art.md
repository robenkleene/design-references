# Illustrator Gradient Art

1. Select the Pen tool (`P`), turn off the fill color and set the stroke color to black
2. Draw a wavy line
3. Draw a second wavy line down below, a bit smaller horizontally and with some intricate details like loops
4. Create a blend between the two curves: Select both curves using the selection tool (`V`), then switch to the Blend tool (`W`), and click on the farthest left starting point of the top curve, then the farthest left starting point of the bottom curve (the Blend tool cursor should have a "+"). This creates a blending object between the two curves.
