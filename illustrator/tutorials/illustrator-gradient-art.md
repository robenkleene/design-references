# Illustrator Gradient Art

1. Select the Pen tool (`P`), turn off the fill color and set the stroke color to black
2. Draw a wavy line
3. Draw a second wavy line down below, a bit smaller horizontally and with some intricate details like loops
4. Create a blend between the two curves: Select both curves using the selection tool (`V`), then switch to the Blend tool (`W`), and click on the farthest left starting point of the top curve, then the farthest left starting point of the bottom curve (the Blend tool cursor should have a "+"). This creates a blending object between the two curves.
5. To increase the number of steps, double click the blending tool icon, change the spacing to "Specified Steps", set the steps to `106".
6. To add some more variation: Use the Pen tool (`P`) to draw another curve to the left that looks a bit like a spiral. Select all the curves (`⌘A`), then select "Object > Blend > Replace Spine".
7. You can edit the spine curve by double-clicking and using the Direct Selection tool (`A`)
8. Select all (`⌘A`) and increase the "Specified Steps" to `181` by double-clicking the Blend tool.

## Create a Background

1. Add a rectangle behind the design that's the same size as the artboard, and set its color to a dark blue.

## Tweak Design

1. With the design select, go to "Window > Stroke" and set the "Weight: `0.5`".
