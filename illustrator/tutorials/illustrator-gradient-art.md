# Illustrator Gradient Art

## 1. Curved Paths With Spine

1. Select the Pen tool (`P`), turn off the fill color and set the stroke color to black
2. Draw a wavy line
3. Draw a second wavy line down below, a bit smaller horizontally and with some intricate details like loops
4. Create a blend between the two curves: Select both curves using the selection tool (`V`), then switch to the Blend tool (`W`), and click on the farthest left starting point of the top curve, then the farthest left starting point of the bottom curve (the Blend tool cursor should have a "+"). This creates a blending object between the two curves.
5. To increase the number of steps, double click the blending tool icon, change the spacing to "Specified Steps", set the steps to `106".
6. To add some more variation: Use the Pen tool (`P`) to draw another curve to the left that looks a bit like a spiral. Select all the curves (`⌘A`), then select "Object > Blend > Replace Spine".
7. You can edit the spine curve by double-clicking and using the Direct Selection tool (`A`)
8. Select all (`⌘A`) and increase the "Specified Steps" to `181` by double-clicking the Blend tool.

### Create a Background

1. Add a rectangle behind the design that's the same size as the artboard, and set its color to dark blue.

### Tweak Design

1. With the design selected, go to "Window > Stroke" and set the "Weight: `0.5`", and set the stroke color to white.
2. The design looks better if the spline has even spacing, tweak the spine curve to even out the spacing. An easy way to do this is to switch to the "Anchor Point Tool" (`⇧C`)` and adjust the curve's point.

### Gradient

1. Add a gradient to two non-spine curves (top and bottom curves). To add the gradient, select a curve in the Layers panel (click the circle to the right), then select "Window > Gradient", click the stroke once to select it, then click the gradient color well once to apply it.
2. Use a different color for the top curve and the curve.

## 2. Wavy Shape

1. Make a dark background and draw a wavy shape with the Pen tool with the two end points ending up close to each other, but not closing the shape.
