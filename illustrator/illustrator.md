## Previewing Colors

To preview color, select "Edit" -> "Edit Colors" -> "Recolor Artwork..." (the colors can then be adjusted live with the sliders, although the color picker still won't live preview from here).

You can also preview a color by using a global swatch, double click a swatch and make sure the "Global" checkbox is checked. Then use the swatch as a color (e.g., by dragging it to the stroke box), then when the "Preview" box is checked, the color can be previewed live.

## Swatches

To delete all swatches, use the swatches contextual menu "Select All Unused" and then type the delete key.

## Resizing

The easiest way to resizes is by dragging the bounding box, you may need to show it with "View" -> "Show Bounding Box"

## Tips

- If importing an image messes up it's colors, just open and export that image from Photoshop and that should fix it.
- To duplicate a path, choose `Duplicate` from the Layers panel menu

## Expand

- "Expand" means to make the different elements that make up an object into separate objects, usually this means turning the stroke into a separate object.
- "Expand Appearance" is the same as "Expand" but for "Appearance" effects.

## Saving

Unfortunately, there's no way to bypass the `Illustrator Options` pane when saving a new document.
