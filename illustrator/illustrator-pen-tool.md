# Illustrator Pen Tool

- `⇧C`: Anchor Point Tool, to add handles
- `A`: Direct Selection Tool, to select a point
- `V`: Selection Tool, to select the whole shape
- To draw from an existing anchor point (e.g., to avoid deleting the existing anchor point) simply deselect the existing path first

## Notes

- To remove an anchor point, click it with the pen tool.
- To reset the handles, use the Pen tool, and `⌥-click` the point, and drag to get straight, mirrored, handles again.
