# Illustrator Text

- `⇧⌘<` / `⇧⌘>`: Decrease / increase font size
- `⌘↩`: Stop editing a text field
- `⌘T`: Show `Character` panel

## Notes

- The Eye Dropper tool can be used to copy styles between text layers. Just select the destination layer, switch to the Eye Dropper tool (`I`) and click the layer to copy styles from.
- The equivalent of "Type > Convert to Paragraph Text" is "Convert to Area Type" and "Convert to Point Type". You can toggle it by double-clicking the lollipop indicator that appears when you select text.
