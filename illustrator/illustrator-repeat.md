# Illustrator Repeat

## Radial

- `Object > Repeat > Radial` then set the parameters under `Properties`.
- There doesn't appear to be a way to edit the initial path again without disabling `Object > Repeat > Release` and starting over.

### Positioning

The radial controls have GUI controls for the number of instances and the size of the radius, but the GUI controls can't be constrained, these same properties can also be found on the `Properties` panel.

- Positioning is usually a combination of sizing the bounding box and setting a radius in the `Properties` panel (under `Repeating Options`).
