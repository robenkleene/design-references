# Illustrator Grid

## Grid

- `⌘'`: Toggle grid
- `⇧⌘'`: Toggle snap to grid
- `Settings > Guides & Grid`: Configure the grid

## Snapping

- To turn on snapping to objects, select `View > Smart Guides` (`⌘U`)

## Tips

- It can be hard to see the difference between grid lines and subdivisions. It's much easier if you set the grid color to black (then the subdivision lines will be gray).
