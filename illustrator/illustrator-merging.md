# Illustrator Merging

Merging various kinds of shapes into one path.

## Remove Fills

Before simplifying, make sure fills are only being used where they should be. The easiest way to do this is to turn on `Simulate Colored Paper` under `File > Document Setup...` (then choose a color in the top color well, sometimes the color doesn't take effect until also editing then exiting the artboard).

## Simplifying Shapes

Shapes usually need to be converted before they can be merged into a single shape.

### Strokes

If your shape uses strokes, the strokes need to be converted to the path itself (unless the entire merged shape will have one stroke size.)

- `Object > Path > Outline Stroke`

### Repeating Objects

Repeating objects have to be converted to simple shapes.

- `Object > Expand...`

## Merge

To move all the paths into one group.

- `Pathfinder > Merge`

## Unite

Combine shapes into one shape.

- `Pathfinder > Unite`
