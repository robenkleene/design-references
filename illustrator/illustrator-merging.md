# Illustrator Merging

Merging various kinds of shapes into one path.

## Simplifying Shapes

Shapes usually need to be converted before they can be merged into a single shape.

### Strokes

If your shape uses strokes, the strokes need to be converted to the path itself (unless the entire merged shape will have one stroke size.)

- `Object > Path > Outline Stroke`

### Repeating Objects

Repeating objects have to be converted to simple shapes.

- `Object > Expand...`
