# Adobe Lightroom Classic

## Import Workflow

1. Export from Photos as Unmodified Originals, then delete the JPGs
2. Import in Lightroom Classic as "Move"
3. Into One Folder (this is because Lightroom Mobile doesn't support folders by date anyway)
4. Automatically add to the "Work" collection, this is so the photos get synced

Also move any files in the Lightroom `Mobile Downloads.lrdata` directory here (this is where photos synced from Lightroom Mobile are added to)

## Shortcuts

Edits are made in the develop module.

- `d`: Go to develop module
- `e`: Go to loupe view
- `g`: Go to grid view (tap again to toggle between types of grid

## Develop Module

- `k`: Adjustment brush
- `⇧`: Move sliders by larger increments
- `h`: Hide UI of whatever tool is being used

### Adjustment Brush

- `⌥`: Switch to eraser
- `o`: Toggle showing the adjustment brush area
- when the adjustment brush is active, the bar below the photo will have a done button.
- The brush head can be edited in the "brush" section.
- Use "Auto Mask" checkbox to isolate the brush to similar parts of the photo (e.g., to capture just the subject, a bit like Photoshop's "Magic Wand" tool).

### Spot Removal

- `h`: Hide the UI making it easy to layer spot removals
- Click once and it will try to automatically remove the object.
- The Spot Removal tool is also a brush, so you can click and drag to affect a non-circular area.

#### Options

- `Heal`: Intelligently remove object
- `Clone`: Exactly remove object

### Alignment

- Use the transform panel (under "Window" -> "Panels" -> "Transform") and just select "auto".
