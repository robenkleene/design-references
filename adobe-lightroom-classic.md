# Adobe Lightroom Classic

## Import Workflow

1. Export from Photos as Unmodified Originals, then delete the JPGs
2. Import in Lightroom Classic as "Move"
3. Into One Folder (this is because Lightroom Mobile doesn't support folders by date anyway)
4. Automatically add to the "Work" collection, this is so the photos get synced

Also move any files in the Lightroom `Mobile Downloads.lrdata` directory here (this is where photos synced from Lightroom Mobile are added to)
