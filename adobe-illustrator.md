# Adobe Illustrator

- `⌘'`: Toggle grid
- `⇧⌘`: Toggle snap to grid
- `⌥drag`: To zoom

## Tools

- `⌥Click`: Get to tool settings (e.g., change number of vertices in the polygon tool)

## Previewing Colors

To preview color, select "Edit" -> "Edit Colors" -> "Recolor Artwork..." (the colors can then be adjusted live with the sliders, although the color picker still won't live preview from here).

You can also preview a color by using a global swatch, double click a swatch and make sure the "Global" checkbox is checked. Then use the swatch as a color (e.g., by dragging it to the stroke box), then when the "Preview" box is checked, the color can be previewed live.
