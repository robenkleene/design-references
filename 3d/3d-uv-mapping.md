# 3D UV Mapping

UV mapping is used for texture mapping. The `U` and `V` correspond to the horizontal and vertical axes. They're used instead of `XY` because `XY` are already used for object coordinates.

- UV coordinates are typically from `0` to `1`, with `0, 0` being the bottom-left corner and `1, 1` the upper-right, this applies to both the model and the texture.
