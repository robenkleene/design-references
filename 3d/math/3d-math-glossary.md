## Radian

A radian is the angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc that is equal in length to the radius.

- $2 \pi$ rad is $360^\circ$
- $\pi$ rad is $180^\circ$
- $\frac{\pi}{2}$ rad is $90^\circ$

### Explanation

- **Radius**: Distance from the center to any point on the circle.
- **Arc**: Any part of the circumference of the circle.
- **Subtended Arc**: The angle between to lines that connect from the center of a circle to the two ends of an arc.
- $2 \pi$ rad as $360^\circ$ can be calculated using the arc length function $\ell _\text{arc}=2\pi r(\tfrac{\theta }{360^{\circ }})$ or $1=2\pi ({\tfrac {1{\text{ rad}}}{360^{\circ }}})$, which simplifies to $1={\tfrac {2\pi {\text{ rad}}}{360^{\circ }}}$. Multiplying both sides by $360^\circ$ gives $360^\circ = $2 \pi \text{ rad}$.

## Euler Angles

In the context Euler angles, the $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ are symbols are commonly assigned to specific axes as follows:

- $\alpha$ is the angle of rotation around the X-axis,
- $\beta$ is the angle of rotation around the Y-axis,
- $\gamma$ is the angle of rotation around the Z-axis.
