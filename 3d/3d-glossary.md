- **IPR:** Interactive preview rendering
- **Multipass:** A technique where the rendering process is broken down into different passes, each handling a specific aspect of the final image (e.g., so the different layers can be composited together in post)
- **Volumetric Lighting:** Beams of light (named that way because it enhances the sense of volume)
