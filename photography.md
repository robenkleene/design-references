# Photography

## Exposure

Process of letting light through the lens to the sensor.

Three factors affect every exposure:

1. Aperture
2. Shutter Speed
3. ISO

An example of when to use manual exposure: If you're shooting a shot with a white background, the camera is going to overcompensate and make the photo to dark.

## ISO

Light sensitivity, the lower the number, the less sensitive the camera is to light, so reduce the number on bright sunny days. Low ISO mean slow noise, high ISO means high noise.

### ISO Ranges

- 32 to 100: Great, low noise
- 100 to 400: Good, medium noise
- 400 to 800: Be Careful, medium noise
- 800 to 1600: Watch Out, high noise

## Focus

A camera can only focus on one point at a time, but there's an area in front and behind that point called the "zone of sharpness" or "depth of field".

Four factors affect focus:

1. Aperture
2. Focal length: Distance from the sensor to the lens.
3. Light level
4. Focus distance

Since the aperture and focal length are fixed on an iPhone, the main component we have control over is the focus distance (the distance from the camera to the subject). This means to get as much blur of your background as possible, reduce the focus distance by getting as close as possible to the subject.

The iPhones can focus three ways:

1. Autofocus
2. Tap to Focus
3. Manual Focus

Manual focus is best when you want to refine your focus, usually to get a blurred background with a close up shot of your subject.

## Tips

Shoot within an hour of sunrise or sunset for great light.

## White Balance

White balance is about making your photos look as natural and neutral as possible.

White balance is to adjust temperature. Exposure is how light and dark a photo is, white balance is the color "cast" of the photo.

Auto white balance works great outdoors, but it struggles with mixed lighting, indoor lighting, and high-contrast lighting.

Here's how the white balance settings map to color temperature:

- 1000K Candlelight
- 2000K Incandescent
- 3000K Sunrise/Sunset
- 4000K Fluorescent (White)
- 5000K Daylight
- 6000K Flash
- 7000K Cloudy
- 8000K Shade

Essentially what this means is the lower the white balance setting, the more blue will be added to the photo, and the higher, the more red. (But the goal should be to make the shot as neutral and natural as possible.)

### Temperature

Temperature is in Kelvin. Warm colors (lower temperature 1000K) are toward the red part of the spectrum, cold colors (higher temperature 8000K) are towards the blue part of the spectrum.
