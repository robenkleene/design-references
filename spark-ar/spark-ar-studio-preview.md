# Spark AR Preview

To use the Spark AR preview window for testing:

1. Position the camera so it's pointing at the asset by selecting the menu in the lower right and choosing `Simulate Orbit`
    - It's probably a good idea to also reposition the asset to make it appear in the default camera position
