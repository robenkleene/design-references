# Spark AR Studio

## Device

- `WASD`: Movement when hovering the device
- `⌘-click-drag`: Move an object that's a child of a `placer` object
- `⌘⌥-click-drag`: Rotate and scale object that's a child of a `placer` object

## Tips

- Use `Null Object` as an abstraction layer, e.g., to scale it's children uniformly without having to scale each object individually.
