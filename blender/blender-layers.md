# Blender Layers

- To make a layer transparent, toggle on `Render Properties > Film > Transparent`.
- To add a layer, click `Add View Layer` in the upper right.
- You can only hide objects on layers if they're in collections. Select the layer and then uncheck the Collection (or hit `E` for "exclude").
