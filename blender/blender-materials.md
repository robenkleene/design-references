# Blender Materials

## Commonly Used Properties

- **Base Color**
- **Roughness**: How reflective a material is, higher means more reflective. (Reflectiveness can also be changed with specular, but changing it with roughness is more accurate to the physical world.)
- **Normal**: Bumpiness
- **Subsurface**: Whether light enters the object and bounces around (humans and food tend to have this property).
- **Subsurface Radius**: How far the light bounces around inside the object. There's three values, one for each channel (red, green, blue).
