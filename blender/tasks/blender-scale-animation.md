# Blender Scale Animation

To scale an animation, e.g., if you've changed the number of frames and then want to space an animation over that number of frames.

1. Move the playhead to the first frame
2. Select `2D Cursor` from the `Pivot Point` dropdown, this scales the animation relative to the playhead
3. Select all points with `A`
4. Use `S X` to scale the points on the X axis
