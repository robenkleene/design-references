# Blender Debugging

## Node Wrangler

The "Node Wrangler" add-on has a useful debugging function: `⇧⌃click` an outlet and a "Viewer" node will immediately be created from that outlet to the output. (Note that this will also *delete* any output connects that already exist!)

After a viewer is setup this way, the easiest way to see its output is to go to the "Material Properties" of an object that has this shader applied and view it under the "Preview" there.

To use Node Wrangler, thee add-on must first be enabled in "Preferences > Add-Ons".
