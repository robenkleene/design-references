# Blender Debugging

## Node Wrangler

The "Node Wrangler" add-on has a useful debugging function: `⇧⌃click` an outlet and a "Viewer" node will immediately be created from that outlet to the output. Note that this will also *delete* any output connects that already exist!

To use Node Wrangler, thee add-on must first be enabled in "Preferences > Add-Ons".
