# Blender Modeling

## Operations

- `⇧␣`: Operation menu

### Switching Operations

When the mode menu is visible, use these shortcuts to change modes.

- `␣`: Cursor

The following can also just be hit directly to immediately start doing the corresponding action:

- `g`: Move ("grab")
- `r`: Rotate
- `s`: Scale
- `b`: Select

## Meshes

### Sphere

The difference between sphere types is how they're modeled.

- **UV Sphere**: Modeled vertical lines (similar to longitude and latitude lines).
- **Ico Sphere**: Modeled like a polyhedron, with many faces.

### Tips

- Once one of the above actions is attached, tapping the corresponding axis letter, e.g., `z`, `x`, or `y` will lock the movement into that axis.
- To transform by a factor, hit the transform key then a number, e.g., `s10↩` will scale up `10x`
- `↩` accepts the operation
- Right-click or `ESC` cancels any of the above actions.

### Middle Mouse Button

A middle mouse button tap can be used to lock the manipulation into a particular action. The sequence looks like:

1. Tap a manipulation shortcut, e.g., `g` to move
2. Move the mouse slightly in the correct axis
3. Hold `⌥` and tap to lock it into that axis

With "Edit" > "Preferences" > "Input" > "Emulate 3 Button Mouse" enabled, hold `⌥` to emulate a three button mouse.
