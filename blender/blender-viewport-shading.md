# Blender Viewport Shading

## Radial Menu

#### Giving Objects Colors

- `Viewport Shading: Solid` has a quick way to give meshes in colors in the viewport (without assign materials) by setting `Viewport Shading > Color: Object` (this option isn't available in other `Viewport Shading` modes). To assign a color to an object, select it, then set `Object > Viewport Display > Color`.
