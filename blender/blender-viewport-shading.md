# Blender Viewport Shading

- `Z`: Bring up radial menu to choose shading

## Radial Menu

- `M`, `2`: Material preview
- `W`, `4`: Wireframe
- `S`, `6`: Solid
- `R`, `8`: Show rendered

## Notes

- To remove the background, click the `Viewport Shading` drop-down in the upper right, and set the `World Opacity: 0`

## Modes

### Object Color Mode

`Object Color` mode is a quick way to give objects in the viewport colors without having to assign them materials.

To enable object color mode, switch to `Viewport Shading: Solid` (`Z 6` while hovering the viewport). Then open the disclosure arrow next to `Viewport Shading` and choose `Color: Object` (this option won't be available in other `Viewport Shading` modes).

To assign a color to an object, select it, then set `Object > Viewport Display > Color`.
