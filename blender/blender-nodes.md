# Blender Nodes

## Coordinates

Three main nodes for working with coordinates:

- Texture coordinates tell Blender where to position colors on the mesh.
- Coordinates are position information, and therefore vectors (a vector is an X, Y, and Z value representing coordinates in 3D space).

2. **Texture Coordinate**
3. **Geometry**
