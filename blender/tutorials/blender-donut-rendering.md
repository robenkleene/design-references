# Blender Donut Rendering

Before doing this tutorial, there needs to be a camera and a light in the scene.

1. Switch to render view mode (`z`, then select "Rendered" or click the farthest right "Viewport Shading" mode in the upper right of the viewport)
2. Move a light source close to the subject so you can see the shading.
3. Add a plane with (`â‡§A`, "Mesh > Plane") that the subject can cast shadows onto
4. Move the subject up so it's sitting on the plane (`g z` then move the mouse).
