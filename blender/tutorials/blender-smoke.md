# Blender Smoke

1. With the default starting cube selected, choose `Objects > Quick Effects > Quick Smoke`.
2. Resize with `s` until the X and Y are about `8` and the Z is about `12`.
3. Move up with `gz` until the simulation is sitting on the plane.
4. Turn on `Physics Properties > Settings > Adaptive Domain` which will improve baking times.
5. Set `Physics Properties > Cache > Frame End: 250` (the length of the scene).

## Notes

- Smoke Color is under "Physics Properties > Smoke", then "Type: Flow"
