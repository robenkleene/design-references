1. Starting with a default animation that moves a sphere up, and then back down.
2. Select the right side handle for the first keyframe, hit `G` and drag the mouse over towards the left.
3. Do the same for the farthest right keyframe, select the left side of the handle and drag it over towards the right.
4. Select the center handle for the middle keyframe, hit `S` to scale and move the top handle longer horizontally. (It's useful to play the animation here and adjust the bounce visually.)
