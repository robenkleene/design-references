# Blender Glow

1. Make an object
2. Change the `World Properties > Color` to black to make the glow easier to see.
3. With the object selected, under `Material Properties` make a new material. Set `Surface: Emission` and set the color and strength to taste.
4. Turn on `Viewport Shading`, the object will be emitting light but not glowing.
5. Toggle on `Render Properties > Bloom`, and the object will be glowing.
