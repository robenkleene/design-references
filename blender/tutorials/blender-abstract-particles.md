# Blender Abstract Particles

1. Add an icosphere (`A`, "Mesh > icosphere"), this will be the emitter.
2. Scale down (`gs`) the icosphere to about `0.82`.
3. Add second icosphere on this one in the lower left new object panel, change the subdivisions to `1`. This will be the particle.
4. Move the second icosphere to the left (`gx`) to about `10`, and scale it down (`gs`) to abut `0.25`.
5. Put the second icosphere in a new collection called "Particle" (`m` "New Collection").
