## Splits

### Splitting

- You can also create splits just by right-clicking a boundary and selecting "Vertical Split" or "Horizontal Split". After selecting a split type, the cursor will change and you'll be able to choose the size of the split.
- You can split from the right or left by moving your cursor to one of the corners until you see a `+` shaped cursor, and drag the split out.

### Joining

- You can join two splits by right-clicking a boundary and selecting "Join Areas". After selecting "Join Areas", your cursor will change and you can select which split to close.
- To close a split, join the split you want to keep into the split you want to remove. To join splits, hover the cursor over a corner of the split you want to keep until you see the `+` and drag towards the split you want to close until the cursor turns into an `>` and then release. Note that joining will fail if it would involve joining more than two splits, e.g., you can't join a row with two vertical splits into a row with one horizontal split. To do so, first you need to join the two vertical splits, so that there are just two horizontal splits, then you can join the two horizontal splits.
