# Blender Camera

- `⌃⌥0` / `⌘⌥0`: Align Camera to View (e.g., set the camera to this view)
- `0`: View through the camera

## Aligning

With the camera selected, you can then use:

- `g`: Pan
- `r`: Rotate

## Lock

To "Lock Camera to View", hit `n` with the main view focused to bring up a side panel with additional options, then select the "View" panel, and click "Lock Camera to View".

## Rolling

Previous to `2.8`, there was a binding to roll the view port with `⇧⌃` and two-finger scroll, but there's no built-in binding for this in Blender 2.8. A binding can be added by targeting `view3d.view_roll`.

There is a workaround if the intention is to roll to get a good camera view: Select the camera and hit `r`, then a single-finger drag will roll the camera's view.
