# Blender Troubleshooting

## Orbit

If orbit is pivoting around the wrong point, you can fix this by hitting `Numpad .`. There's no key equivalent for this on a laptop, the menu equivalent is "View > Frame Selected". (There's also a permanent preference that resolves this called "Preferences > Navigation > Orbit Around Selection".

## Viewport Pan & Zoom Stuck

If you can orbit, but can't pan or zoom, try hitting the `HOME` key, or selecting `View > Frame All`.
