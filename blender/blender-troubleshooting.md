# Blender Troubleshooting

## Orbit

If orbit is pivoting around the wrong point, you can fix this by hitting `Numpad .`. There's no key equivalent for this on a laptop, the menu equivalent is "View > Frame Selected". (There's also a permanent preference that resolves this called "Preferences > Navigation > Orbit Around Selection".

## Viewport Pan & Zoom Stuck

If you can orbit, but can't pan or zoom, try hitting the `HOME` key, or selecting `View > Frame All`.

## Missing Camera

If the camera isn't being displayed in the viewport, just a square when it's selected. Then overlays might have been toggled off, click the `Show Overlays` button at the top of the viewport.

## Auto Keying

If auto keying is on and key frames aren't updating, just update them manually by right-clicking and selecting `Replace Keyframes`. Auto keying will usually start working next time.
