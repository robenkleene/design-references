## Notes

- You can right click an option in the UI to assign a keyboard shortcut to it (e.g., right click `Lock camera to view` to assign a keyboard shortcut to it, even though there isn't one by default.
- You can also add a button to `Quick Favorites` by right-clicking it and selecting `Add to Quick Favorites`. These appear to be per viewport type (e.g., the `3D Viewport` has different quick favorites then `Timeline`).
