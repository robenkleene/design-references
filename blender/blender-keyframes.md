# Blender Keyframes

- `i`: Insert key frame (if you're hovering over a parameter, add a keyframe for that parameter)

## Graph Editor

- `HOME`: Try to make the graph fit in the view.

## Camera Animations

1. Create a setup where the view is split with a view through the active camera on the right, and a view where you can use the transform tools on the camera on the left.
2. Turn on `Auto Keying`.
3. Move the camera recording keyframes.

### Tips

- Hit the record button (`Auto Keying`) to make it so each time a change is made a keyframe is automatically added.
- Hover mouse over a parameter and hit `i` to add a keyframe for that parameter.
- Select the second key frame and drag it to adjust the speed.
- Hit `HOME` in the Graph Editor to fit the graph to the frame.
