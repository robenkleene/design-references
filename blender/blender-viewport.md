# Blender Viewport

- `F2`: Rename the currently selected object (`âŒ˜F2` to batch rename)
- `Z`: Bring up radial menu to choose shading
    - `Z R`: Show rendered

## Object Color Mode

`Object Color` mode is a quick way to give objects in the viewport colors without having to assign them materials.

To enable object color mode, switch to `Viewport Shading: Solid` (`Z 6` while hovering the viewport).

To assign a color to an object, select it, then set `Object > Viewport Display > Color`.
