# Final Cut Pro Audio

- `⇧S` / `View > Audio Skimming`: Toggle audio preview (e.g., toggle whether the audio plays while scrubbing)

## Editing

- `⌘B`: Split audio at playhead (just like editing video)

## Adding

To add an audio track, just drag it directly into the timeline. Sometimes the audio becomes `Rejected` and it won't appear in `Events` to see it, choose `All Clips` from the drop-down menu in the upper right of the `Events Panel`.

## Fade In / Out

- `Modify > Adjust Audio Fades > Apply Fades`: Apply audio fades to the beginning and end of the audio
- To adjust the fade in / out duration, hover the audio clip and a location indicator will appear that can be dragged to adjust the timing.
