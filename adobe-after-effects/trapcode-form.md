# Trapcode Form

In Trapcode Form, hit `c` to change the 3D camera tool (switch from orbit to pan or zoom).

## Starting

1. Make a new composition
2. Right-click in timeline panel and choose "New" -> "Solid", and click "Make Comp Size"
3. Right-click the solid and add the Trapcode Form affect to it

## Blend Mode

There's no longer a blend mode option under "Rendering", so instead make a separate layer and change the blend mode of the new layer.

## Great Starting Point
