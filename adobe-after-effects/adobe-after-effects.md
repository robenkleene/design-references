## Grid

## Layers

To change a layers size (as opposed to scaling it), go to "Layer" -> "Layer Settings"

## Shape Layers

- Shape layers can be resized simply via their properties.

## Effects

You can copy and paste effects with `⌘C` and `⌘V`.

## Expressions

- `⌥-click` the stopwatch to immediately enter an expression

### Expression Examples

- Rotation `time * 5` makes an object rotate

## Previews & RAM

The green line is the RAM preview. The blue line is the disk cache. You can adjust the preview resolution under the preview, e.g., change "Full" to "Half" or "Quarter".

- `⌃⌫` / "Edit" -> "Purge" -> "All Memory": Delete the RAM cache

## Export

## Bodymovin

- Make sure "After Effects" -> "Preferences" -> "Scripting & Expressions" -> "Allow Scripts to Write Files and Access Network" is checked

## Gradient Fill

To rotate a gradient fill, select one of its properties in the timeline (like "Start Point"). You'll then be able to move the start and end points of the gradient.

## Lights & Cameras

When using lights and cameras, turn on the "Adaptive Resolution" preview preference so you can see what you are doing as you make changes.

## Preferences

- `⌘⌥` ("Edit" -> "Keyboard Shortcuts"): Edit keyboard shortcuts

## Glossary

- For some reason toggling the disclosure indicators is called "Twirling".

## Tips & Tricks

- To edit properties on multiple layers at once: Use the search field above the properties list and search for the property you want to change, then select each one and change the value.
