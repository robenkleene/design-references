# Adobe After Effects

## Previews & RAM

The green line is the RAM preview. The blue line is the disk cache. You can adjust the preview resolution under the preview, e.g., change "Full" to "Half" or "Quarter".

- `⌃⌫` / "Edit" -> "Purge" -> "All Memory": Delete the RAM cache

## Units

After Effects uses Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) by default, which means "hours, minutes, seconds, and frames".

## Export

1. `⌘M`: "Composition" -> "Add to Render Queue"
2. Click "Render"

## Preferences

- `⌘⌥` ("Edit" -> "Keyboard Shortcuts"): Edit keyboard shortcuts

## Tips

- If you encounter an error trying to import `mov` files, try changing the extension to `mp4`.
- Hold `⌘` to disable snapping
