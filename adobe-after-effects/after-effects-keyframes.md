### Sequence Layers

Select layers, right-click "Keyframe Assistant > Sequence Layers..."

- **Duration**: The duration of the transition. E.g., to have a layer show for a second, and transition for half a second, start with the layers showing for two seconds, then set the duration to half a second (`30`).

#### Transition

- **Dissolve front layer**: Fade out the top layer, with the bottom layer full opacity
- **Cross Dissolve Front and Back Layers**: Fade out the top layer, while fading in the bottom layer
