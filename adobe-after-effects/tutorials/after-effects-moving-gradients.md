# After Effects Moving Gradients

1. Create a new solid layer (`âŒ˜Y`)
2. Add a "Fill" effect from under "Effects & Presets" to the layer to give it a color. (This is to make it easy to change the color.)
3. Use the pen tool to draw a mask around a shape. (Make sure "Tool Creates Mask" is selected. This is the default and can't be change if the layer is a solid.)
4. Add a feather to the layer in the timeline. (`f` reveals the feather value in the timeline, increase the value.)
