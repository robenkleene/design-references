# After Effects Moving Gradients

## Setup the First Layer

1. Create a new solid layer (`⌘Y`)
2. Add a "Fill" effect from under "Effects & Presets" to the layer to give it a color. (This is to make it easy to change the color.)
3. Use the pen tool to draw a mask around a shape. (Make sure "Tool Creates Mask" is selected. This is the default and can't be change if the layer is a solid.)
4. Add a feather to the layer in the timeline. (`f` reveals the feather value in the timeline, increase the value.)

## Animate the First Layer

1. Add a "Turbulent Displace" effect
2. In "Effect Controls" for the Turbulent Displace affect, edit an expression (`⌥click` the Evolution stopwatch), enter `time * 100` as the expression (`enter` / `fn-return` to save).
3. Change the "Size" of the Turbulent Displace to `350`.
