# After Effects Layers

- `⌘[` / `⌘]`: Move a layer forward / backward (in front or behind other layers)
- `[` / `]`: Move a layer to the start or end at the playhead
- `⌥[` / `⌥]`: Clip a layer so it starts or ends at the playhead
- `i` / `o`: Move the playhead to the start or end of a layer
- `⌘Y`: Add solid, e.g., for a background

## Scaling

To scale something from the bottom right corner: Switch to the "Pan Behind (Anchor Point) Tool" (`Y`) and move the anchor point to the upper left corner, then switch to the "Selection Tool" (`V`) and drag from the lower right corner. After resizing, it's probably a good idea to move the anchor point back to the center.

### Shape Layers

- Shape layers can be resized simply via their properties.
- To rotate a gradient fill, select one of its properties in the timeline (like "Start Point"). You'll then be able to move the start and end points of the gradient.

### Fitting a Layer to a Composition

- "Layer > Transform > Fit to Comp" / `⌥⌘F`
- "Layer > Transform > Fit to Comp Width" / `⌥⇧⌘H`
- "Layer > Transform > Fit to Comp Height" / `⌥⇧⌘G`

## Color

Change color settings in "File" -> "Project Settings...", 8-bit is `0-255`

## Tips

- To change a layers size (as opposed to scaling it), go to "Layer" -> "Layer Settings"
