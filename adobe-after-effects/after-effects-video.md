# After Effects Video

## Freeze Frame

### Quick

Put the playhead where you want your freeze frame and right-click and select: 

- "Time > Freeze Frame": Freeze the frame for *the whole duration of the clip*
- "Time > Freeze On Last Frame": Freeze on the last frame and add to the clip length, you can then drag to increase the clip length

### Freeze a Specific Frame

Freeze frames in After Effects work just like any other keyframes using the "Time Remap" property. So just create a keyframe that holds the time where you want to clip to freeze.
