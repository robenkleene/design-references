# DaVinci Resolve

- `Media` tab is for organizing media
- In the `Project Manager` the `Untitled Project` is a shortcut to create a new project, not an actual project.
- ON the `Medai` tab, drag clisp to the `Media Pool`
- The `Cut` page is meant to be a simpler, faster way to edit than the `Edit` page
