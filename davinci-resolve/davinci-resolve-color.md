# DaVinci Resolve Color

## Color Wheels

Each wheel adjusts a different aspect of the image:

- `Lift`: Darkest
- `Gamma`: Mid-range
- `Gain`: Brightest
- `Offset`: Whole image

### Other Settings

There's also the following settings on the bottom:

- `Col Boost`
- `Shad`
- `Hi/Light`
- `Sat`
- `Hue`
- `L. Mix`

### Notes

- The circle with the dot in the middle controls the hue and saturation.
- The sliders below control the brightness
- The circle in the upper right resets the wheel (or just double-click it)
