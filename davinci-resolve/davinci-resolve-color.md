# DaVinci Resolve Color

## Color Wheels

Each wheel adjusts a different aspect of the image:

- `Lift`: Darkest
- `Gamma`: Mid-range
- `Gain`: Brightest
- `Offset`: Whole image

### Notes

- The circle with the dot in the middle controls the hue and saturation.
- The sliders below control the brightness
