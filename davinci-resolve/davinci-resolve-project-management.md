# DaVinci Resolve Project Management

- To close a project, click the home button in the lower right to bring up the project picker, then right-click the project in the picker and choose `Close`
- Closed projects can be deleted on the right click menu

## Notes

- DaVinci resolve projects are stored in a database and just reference assets on the file system
- Projects can be imported and exported

## Archiving

There are two archive options:

1. `Export Project...`: Exports just the project file, after importing, everything will need to be re-linked (files will need to be located)
2. `Export Project Archive...`: Exports the project with media
